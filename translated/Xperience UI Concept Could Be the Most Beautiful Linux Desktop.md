**The Xperience UI is a proof of concept developed for a Nitrux built OS, and if it will ever be brought to fruition, it will probably be one of the most beautiful desktops around.**

Most Linux desktop can be easily recognized by the members of the community and even if some people manage to get the operating system to look interesting, the Nitrux Xperience UI concept is absolutely gorgeous.

Nitrux developers are mostly known for the icon packs and for a few other endeavors, but the quality of this desktop surpasses almost everything that we can find today.

It reminds a little of elementary OS, but at the same time it features a very serious and distinctive look. It’s hard to see of the details, but the notification area, the lockscreen, and the dashbroad are to die for.

The concept seems to be oriented towards touch screens, but it would also do wonders on a desktop system. We can only hope that one of the upcoming distros that are supposed to be in development under the Nitrux wing will actually look like this.

Even if it will never make it (although we have high hopes that it will), this is proof that Linux designs is head and shoulders above all other operating systems out there.
