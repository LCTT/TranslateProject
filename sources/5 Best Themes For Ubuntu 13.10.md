Not satisfied with the default Ambiance theme in Ubuntu? Why not use another theme to change the looks of your desktop by changing the themes? If you are not sure of what themes would be good for you, I have listed here the **best themes for Ubuntu 13.10**. Before we see the themes, a quick word on how to use these themes.

### Installing themes in Ubuntu 13.10 ###

There are two ways to use themes in Ubuntu, either you add it via a PPA or you download the file. If you download the theme file, extract it to **~/.themes** or **/user/share/themes** directory. If you add it via PPA, nothing special needed. 

Next step is to use the installed themes. You can use Unity Tweak Tool to apply the installed themes. Refer to this article for a screenshot tutorial on [how to install themes in Ubuntu 13.10][1].

### Best themes for Ubuntu 13.10 Unity: ###

Most of the themes are divided in themes and icon set. I would advise to install both themes and icons from the same set to make it look more beautiful. Without further ado, lets see the list of best themes for Ubuntu 13.10:

### Numix ###

Like Nokto, Flattastic too does not have its own icon set but you can use any flat icon set with it as it blends very well. Though its not available through PPA, you can install it by downloading the files from [here][4]. Once downloaded, extract the zipped file to /usr/share/themes directory. Later you can use Unity Tweak Tool to use the theme.

And that ends the list of 5 best themes for Ubuntu 13.10. You may want to check similar article that lists the [best icon sets for Ubuntu][5]. What you think of these themes? Do you have a hot favorite theme apart from those mentioned here? Do share it with us.
