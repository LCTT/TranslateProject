Five of the Best Ubuntu 14.04 Wallpaper Contest Entries
================================================================================
**With less than one week to go until its deadline, the Ubuntu 14.04 wallpaper contest pool is overflowing with stunning submissions, all vying for a place on the default Ubuntu install image.**

Ahead of the panel picking their favourites in early March I had a rummage through the entries myself.

Whether or not any of the choices highlighted below are selected for inclusion in the Trusty Tahr is beside the point; these are some fantastic creative snaps that are worthy of a place on anyone’s desktop.

### Best Cat Entry ###

It’s a tradition of ours to also highlight a cat-themed submission. Why? Because cats are so dang cool, yo! Thankfully (yes, cos picking between cute moggies is always difficult) there was just one lone feline entry this year:

But who cares what we here at OMG! think – which entries from the pool are you hoping make it onto the default image?
