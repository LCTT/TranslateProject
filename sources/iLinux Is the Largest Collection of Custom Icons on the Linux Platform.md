================================================================================
**iLinux Icons is probably the largest collection of icons on the Linux platforms and it takes its inspiration from Linux, Windows, and Mac OS systems.**

There are very few quality icon packs available on the Linux platform, even if there are literally hundreds of different packages available.

The developers of iLinux Icons have managed to get icons that resemble (and even surpass in some cases) those on three different platforms: Ubuntu, Windows, and Mac OS.

The installation is very simple and can be done with the help of a simple PPA. Just enter the following commands in terminal:

    sudo add-apt-repository ppa:noobslab/icons2
    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install ilinux-icons

You will also need Ubuntu Tweak or GNOME Tweak tool in order to apply the icons. You can also check the official [website](http://haniahmed.deviantart.com/art/iLinux-icons-v-8-5-354470161) of the developers for more details.
