Ubuntu has been sporting the same kind of background for years, but the upcoming Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (Trusty Tahr) could be the perfect time for a change of scenery.

The Ubuntu design team always aimed as keeping the background simple and familiar. As a rule of thumb, you need to make sure that people recognize the operating system at a glance, just by looking at the colors of the desktop.

The last major change in this direction was at the launch of Ubuntu 10.04 LTS (Lucid Lynx). After Lucid Lynx, the backgrounds have been evolving, from one version to another, in small increments.

Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (Trusty Tahr) might be the time to shake things up a bit. Canonical is also preparing a face lift for the icons and Unity7. What better moment to make Ubuntu 14.04 LTS stand apart from all the ones that came before it?
