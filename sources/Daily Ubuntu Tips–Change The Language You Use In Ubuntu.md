Daily Ubuntu Tips–Change The Language You Use In Ubuntu
================================================================================
Ubuntu, a modern and powerful operating system also allows you to use your desktop in dozens of other languages. By default, there are few language packs installed when you first setup Ubuntu. If you want Ubuntu to support more languages, you must install additional language packs. Not all languages are support, but most languages that are in used and written are supported. This brief tutorial is going to show you how to make this happen.

After installing a language pack, you can also rename standard folders like music, pictures and documents according to your language. You must log off and log back in for the changes to apply. When  you log back in, you’ll prompted and asked if you want to rename these standard folders to match the names for your selected language.

To change which language you use in Ubuntu, click the top right **gear** of the menu bar and select **System Settings**. When the System Settings opens, select **Language Support**.

If prompted to install additional language support, do it. If not, click Install / Remove to install new language packs, then select the language you which to install and install it. Finally, drag the language at the top of the list and save. This change will only apply to your profile. If you which to apply the language settings system-wide, click **Apply System-Wide**.
