
CalculusTouch hits 1.0 version
==========
[CalculusTouch](https://launchpad.net/calculustouch) is a handy Ubuntu SDK application incarnating calculus-specific capabilities into a polished worked-on-detail interface.

Launching CalculusTouch, presents a good-looking mathematical utility featuring a sober-yet-elegant dark background and orange buttons, mix relaxing the eye, while working the brain.

CalculusTouch divides its capabilities in two main areas:

- `Symbolic Calculations` where the user is able to utilize `Evaluate, Derive, Integrate, Taylor Expansion`, etc, as applied to the editable `Expression` field
- `Function Plot` rendering written-by-user expression as accurate visual constructions

CalculusTouch has reached **version 1.0**, strengthening its previously-introduced features into a more stable version, while adding various minor fixes and optimizations.

The 1.0 version comes to meet the user's needs in calculus operations with a more solid feel.

CalculusTouch's usage has a built-in quality of user-friendliness, (for example) performing a symbolic calculation is as simple as typing an expression in the `Expression` field and hitting a desired button (such as `Derive`, etc), action that renders the result with a fancy look & feel into a dedicated white-ish area.
