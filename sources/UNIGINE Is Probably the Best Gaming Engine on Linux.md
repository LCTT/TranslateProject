Unigine Engine is built by non-other than Unigine Corp., the company behind the Heaven DX11 Benchmark software. The technology they develop is getting better all the time, and with their recent expansion on the Linux platform, we’re all too glad to see that major updates have been implemented in the engine.

Amongst the biggest changes in the latest Unigine update is the Common Image Generator Interface (CIGI) protocol.

According to the developers, this interface is a standard way for a host device to communicate with an image generator (IG) in the simulation industry.

### Highlights of the new Unigine Engine: ###

- Support has been added for the conversion of WGS84, ECF and NED coordinate systems into Cartesian one (this will help developers to made better use of real-world GIS data in UNIGINE-powered projects);
- The Game Framework has been implemented, making it easier to create games with features such as automatic link between Entity and Node, automatic link between Level and World, object management for Entities, Global Game context across all Levels, events handling system, optimal updating of Entities, and more;
- The FPS stability for the rendered has been increased;
- Two new options, a 2D noise and 3D noise (States tab in the editor), have been added to the mesh_leaf_base material;
- A new parameter, Occlusion mask, has been added to all of the materials;
- Heights of clutters and grass are synchronized now;
- A few crashes on rendering of non-Flash splash screens have been fixed.

A complete list of new features, for all the platforms, is available in the official [announcement][1].

Keep in mind that the UNIGINE graphics engine is only aimed at commercial enterprises and that not even a trial version is available for the general public.
