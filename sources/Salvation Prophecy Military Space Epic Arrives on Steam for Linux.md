**Salvation Prophecy, a title developed and published on Steam by Firedance Games, has been launched on the Linux platform.**

According to the developers, Salvation Prophecy is a military space epic in which the players will be able to play as fighter pilots in space, but also on the surface of planets, in FPS mode.

“Battles rage as space fleets collide. Invaders clash against fortified enemy colonies. Yet the greatest danger is the impending annihilation foretold by an apocalyptic prophecy. You must seek out the mysteries of distant alien worlds, and master ancient powers to withstand the coming storm,” reads the official [synopsis][1].

The minimum Linux system requirements are pretty low, considering the complexity of the game: Ubuntu 12.04 or Ubuntu 12.10, a Dual-core processor, 2 GB RAM, NVIDIA GeForce 8600 GT, ATI Radeon HD 2600, or better, and 1 GB of available space.

More details about this release can be found on the official Steam [website][2].
