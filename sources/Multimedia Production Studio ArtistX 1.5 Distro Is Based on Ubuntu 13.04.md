==========
**ArtistX 1.5, an Ubuntu-based distribution that aims to enable artists and creators from a number of fields to work via a live and free environment, has just been released.**

The developers have spent almost ten years refining this Linux distribution and the new and improved 1.5 version is now available.

ArtistX 1.5 distribution is based on Ubuntu 13.04 (Raring Ringtail) and it turns a simple computer into a full multimedia production studio.

Just like the Ubuntu system it's based on, ArtistX uses the Linux kernel 3.8 and GNOME 3.6. It also includes 2.500 free multimedia software packages,

According to the developers, ArtistX doesn't use Unity, features all the updates from April 2013 until the time of the release, the Ubiquity installer, and much more.
