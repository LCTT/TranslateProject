Calculator App updated with optimized show/hide calculation description
================================================================================
[Ubuntu Touch Core Apps][1] is an official project where a set of core applications is presently being developed, apps ranging from music players to weather tools and RSS readers.

Under the fruitful roof of Core Apps there is Calculator App, too, calculator utility incorporating handy features into a beautiful interface.

[Calculator App][2] has been updated to a minor-yet-relevant release, further refining its behaviors, in order to deliver a more and more user-friendly highly-usable application with hassle-free feature usage.

Launching Calculator App, the user is to notice a monochrome pencil icon located near each and each calculation, clicking on it, renders multiple underlines where the user is able to on-demand write related-to-the-calculation comments (like for example, pizza cost near a value of 20).

The new Calculator App version adds an optimized behavior to the pencil icon, meaning, clicking now on the pencil icon, renders the dotted underlines (therefore, making the area editable), clicking again on the pencil icon, hides the dotted underlines, therefore, the pencil area is not editable anymore.

The mentioned optimization adds a significant amount of clarity, allowing the user to 1-click/tap away shift a calculation's area as writable or non-writable.

How do we **install** Calculator App 0.1.3?

Add the following **official** PPA (Ubuntu 13.04, Ubuntu 13.10)

    sudo add-apt-repository ppa:ubuntu-sdk-team/ppa && sudo add-apt-repository ppa:ubuntu-touch-coreapps-drivers/daily
    
    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install ubuntu-sdk ubuntu-calculator-app
