NEW YORK and SAN FRANCISCO, February 19, 2014 – Hiring managers are ramping up their plans to bring aboard talent with Linux skills, according to the 2014 Linux Jobs Report, which forecasts the Linux job market based on a survey of hiring managers and Linux professionals.

[The 2014 Linux Jobs Report][1] released today includes data from hiring managers (1,100) and Linux professionals (4,000), providing a comprehensive view of the Linux career landscape from business needs driving demand to personal incentives and job motivations that are most attractive to Linux professionals.

“Enterprises are increasingly describing Linux as a core part of the business,” said Shravan Goli, President of Dice. “In turn, hiring managers are turning up the dial on the incentives offered to technology talent with Linux skills. These professionals are working on projects tightly aligned with a future vision of what enterprises look like.”

This is the third annual Linux Jobs Report produced by Dice, the leading career site for technology and engineering professionals, and The Linux Foundation, the nonprofit organization dedicated to supporting the growth of Linux and collaborative development. The resulting report should help the industry understand what is contributing to Linux job trends and inform employers about the best ways to recruit and retain key Linux talent.

”While demand continues to grow for Linux talent, there remains a shortage of experienced Linux professionals on the market. This year’s Linux Jobs Report clearly illustrates this issue,” said Jim Zemlin, executive director at The Linux Foundation. “This year’s report also shows there is unlimited career advancement for developers and systems administrators who contribute to and seek out learning opportunities for Linux. The future is a bright one for professionals who know Linux.”   

Key statistics from the report include:

- **Finding Linux talent is becoming more of a priority for hiring managers.** Seventy seven percent of hiring managers have “hiring Linux talent” on their list of priorities for 2014, up from 70 percent a year ago. With these strategic priorities set, more than nine in ten hiring managers plan to hire a Linux professional in the next six months.
- **Hiring managers are increasing the number of Linux professionals they are searching for.** Forty six percent of hiring managers are beefing up their plans for recruiting Linux talent over the next six months, representing a three-point increase from hiring managers’ plans in 2013.
- **Knowing Linux advances careers.** Eighty-six percent of Linux professionals report that knowing Linux has given them more career opportunities, and 64 percent say they chose to work with Linux because of its pervasiveness in modern-day technology infrastructure.

The 2014 Linux Jobs Report also includes data about why employers are seeking Linux talent now and what the top incentives are for Linux pros, among other important findings. Download the [complete report][2] today.

### The 2014 Linux Jobs Report Methodology  ###

During November and December 2013, Dice and The Linux Foundation surveyed both hiring managers and Linux professionals about their Linux jobs needs and preferences. Hiring managers from corporations, small and medium businesses (SMBs), government organizations, and staffing agencies were surveyed. More than 1,100 responded with 58 percent indicating their company was headquartered in North America, 21 percent in Europe, seven percent in Asia, four percent in South America, two percent in each of the regions of Africa, Mexico and Central America and Japan, one percent in the Middle East, and less than one percent in Australia/New Zealand. Respondents needed to have hired at least one Linux professional in the last year, or have plans to hire Linux professionals in 2014 to participate in the survey, and they were allowed to check as many responses to questions as appropriate. In addition, more than 4,000 Linux professionals responded to a survey, with 34 percent indicating they’ve been working as a Linux professional for 10 years or more.
