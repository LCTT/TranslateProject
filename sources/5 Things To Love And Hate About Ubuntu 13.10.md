5 Things To Love And Hate About Ubuntu 13.10
================================================================================
Ubuntu 13.10 made a lot of noise before and after its arrival. The OS takes Canonical to a whole new level, especially with the big year that Linux has had in 2013. But now that the dust has settled and there's less talk, let us take a look at five things that you might like and five things that you may hate in the OS.

### LOVE ###

**OpenStack APIs**: Ubuntu 13.10 is compatible with them. In fact, both internal and external Ubuntu-hoster clouds are compatible with OpenStack APIs now.

**Graphical User Interface**: The Unity GUI is now going from PCs to smartphones and tablets as well.

**Upgraded Dashboard**: Ubuntu Dash has been upgraded, which offers users the option to search even the Ubuntu One cloud.

**Good Juju**: In Saucy Salamander, you can use Juju in order to create app instances within Linux containers or LXC.

**GUI is smoother**: Perhaps because of its versatility, the GUI for Saucy Salamander is much smoother than older GUIs.

### HATE ###

**No Mir**: The Unity interface hasn’t moved from X.org to the Mir translator. This was a major let down for many.

**No MariaDB**: The forked MySQL database, MariaDB, has not been introduced by Canonical. This is more surprising than disappointing as most other vendors have already made the move. Canonical’s Ubuntu 13.10 still has MySQL as the default LAMP database.

**Old landscape management tool**: Canonical’s landscape service is not advanced enough. In fact, it is old compared to even the Microsoft System Center that comes with Windows.

**Only two supported phones**: Only the Nexus 4 and the Galaxy Nexus smartphones support Ubuntu 13.10 right now. In addition, only core and shell apps are available for the devices.

**LXC is still beta**: We talked about Juju being used alongside LXC, but LXC itself is still in beta mode. It is supposedly going to get a stable build in February this year.
