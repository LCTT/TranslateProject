Clementine is an excellent media player, and it has been adopted in a lot of new distributions. It's extremely stable and it's made for people who don't actually like the new direction taken by the current generation of music players.

“This release is compatible with the Clementine Remote application for Android which lets you control Clementine remotely from an Android device.”

“Clementine also adds support for Subsonic. And you can now listen to your music stored in Box, Dropbox, Skydrive and Ubuntu One. Last major new feature is the ability to "star" your playlists, so you can safely close them and restore them later from the new "Playlist" tab we've added in the left sidebar,” reads the [announcement][1].

A complete list of changes and new features can be found in the official [announcement][2].
