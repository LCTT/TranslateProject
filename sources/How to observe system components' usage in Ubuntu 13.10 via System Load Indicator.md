How to observe system components' usage in Ubuntu 13.10 via System Load Indicator
================================================================================
[System Load Indicator][1] is a lightweight yet powerful and handy manner of displaying the user's usage of system components on the easiness of the Unity panel.

Basically, System Load Indicator is an appindicator located on the Unity panel that exposes graphs for relevant computer components, such as **CPU**, **RAM**, swap, harddisk, network traffic, etc, permitting a hassle-free observation of the usage of the mentioned components in real time.

System Load Indicator does not require additional efforts or configuration, directly,--after its launch--, presenting the graphs on the Unity panel.

Installing and launching `System Load Indicator` (via the Dash by typing system load indicator in the search area), pushes a single block on the Unity panel, block housing constantly-updated graphs of CPU, component monitored and displayed accordingly by default.

Yet, clicking on `System Load Indicator appindicator-->Preferences` summons a window from where other components can be 1-click away enabled; meaning, (for example) checking `Memory` and `Harddisk`, adds two new blocks on the Unity panel, thus there are now three components monitored by System Load Indicator: CPU, RAM and harddisk.

Under Colors, the user is able to select custom colors for the graphs-enabled blocks, meaning, changing the blue and dark colors to green and orange, renders the CPU's block with green and orange.

Moreover, System Load Indicator pairs its visual-based monitoring with accurate text-based values, clicking on System Load Indicator appindicator, opens its menu where the user is to digest the accurate text-based values of monitored components, values updated in real time.
