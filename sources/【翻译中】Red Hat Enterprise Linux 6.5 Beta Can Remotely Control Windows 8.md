Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.5 includes numerous updates for the existing features set and provides new functionalities in the areas of Subscription Management Services, scalability, networking, storage, virtualization, and security.

“To keep pace with the demand for enterprise-class infrastructure, the newest version of the leading Linux platform extends its scalability and manageability to aid in the build-out and control of large, complex IT environments.”

“For example, Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.5 will be designed to simplify the operation of mission-critical SAP applications by automating the optimal configuration of common SAP deployments,” reads the official [announcement][1].

According to the release notes, Red Hat Enterprise Linux is fully integrated with subscription management services, which is very useful in managing the local system and its allocated subscriptions.

The developers from Red Hat also inform us that Kernel dump files on large systems can now scale to multiple terabytes of data. With the help of a new compression algorithm (LZO) that is used to speed the creation of dump files, the time needed for crash dump generation has been shortened.

One of the most interesting features of Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.5 Beta is its ability to remotely operate Windows 7 and Windows 8 desktops and Windows Server 2012 consoles using the RDP protocol.

Also, the LibreOffice package has been updated to the 4.0 branch, which is actually a nice surprise given the well-known fact that Red Hat only uses time-proven applications and that devs are extremely cautious with what they are adopting for the next release.

The complete release notes can be found in the official announcement.
