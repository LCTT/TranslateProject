The Fedora Project Will No Longer Name Its Linux Distributions
================================================================================
**The Fedora Project has a very colorful history of naming its distributions, but that will come to an end with Fedora 21.**

The Fedora developers have decided that it was time to end the naming policy and process of their Fedora operating system. It's unclear whether the process will be carried out by the community instead, but one thing is certain: the Fedora people will no longer choose the names.

“What will be the code name for Fedora 21. And again short answer: null. Not null as null string but null. Fedora Board decided to end release names process. It does not mean ‘no more release names’ but it's up to community or working groups, if anyone wants to step into the role of Name Wrangler and helps running this process. Or reform it in any way,” said Red Hat's Jaroslav Reznik in a blog [post][1].

This information was made available quite a while ago on an obscure mailing list, but the Fedora Project hasn't been the best communicator possible so far.
