What are good command line HTTP clients?
================================================================================
The whole is greater than the sum of its parts is a very famous quote from Aristotle, a Greek philosopher and scientist. This quote is particularly pertinent to Linux. In my view, one of Linux's biggest strengths is its synergy. The usefulness of Linux doesn't derive only from the huge raft of open source (command line) utilities. Instead, it's the synergy generated by using them together, sometimes in conjunction with larger applications.

The Unix philosophy spawned a "software tools" movement which focused on developing concise, basic, clear, modular and extensible code that can be used for other projects. This philosophy remains an important element for many Linux projects.

Good open source developers writing utilities seek to make sure the utility does its job as well as possible, and work well with other utilities. The goal is that users have a handful of tools, each of which seeks to excel at one thing. Some utilities work well independently.

This article looks at 3 open source command line HTTP clients. These clients let you download files off the internet from a command line. But they can also be used for many more interesting purposes such as testing, debugging and interacting with HTTP servers and web applications. Working with HTTP from the command-line is a worthwhile skill for HTTP architects and API designers. If you need to play around with an API, HTTPie and cURL will be invaluable.

HTTPie (pronounced aych-tee-tee-pie) is an open source command line HTTP client. It is a a command line interface, cURL-like tool for humans.

The goal of this software is to make CLI interaction with web services as human-friendly as possible. It provides a simple http command that allows for sending arbitrary HTTP requests using a simple and natural syntax, and displays colorized output. HTTPie can be used for testing, debugging, and generally interacting with HTTP servers.

#### Features include: ####

- Expressive and intuitive syntax
- Formatted and colorized terminal output
- Built-in JSON support
- Forms and file uploads
- HTTPS, proxies, and authentication
- Arbitrary request data
- Custom headers
- Persistent sessions
- Wget-like downloads
- Python 2.6, 2.7 and 3.x support
- Linux, Mac OS X and Windows support
- Plugins
- Documentation
- Test coverage

![cURL](http://www.linuxlinks.com/portal/content2/png/cURL1.png)

![cURL in action](http://www.linuxlinks.com/portal/content/reviews/Internet/Screenshot-cURL.png)

cURL is an open source command line tool for transferring data with URL syntax, supporting DICT, FILE, FTP, FTPS, GOPHER, HTTP, HTTPS, IMAP, IMAPS, LDAP, LDAPS, POP3, POP3S, RTMP, RTSP, SCP, SFTP, SMTP, SMTPS, TELNET and TFTP.

curl supports SSL certificates, HTTP POST, HTTP PUT, FTP uploading, HTTP form based upload, proxies, cookies, user+password authentication (Basic, Digest, NTLM, Negotiate, kerberos...), file transfer resume, proxy tunneling and a busload of other useful tricks.

#### Features include: ####

- Config file support
- Multiple URLs in a single command line
- Range "globbing" support: [0-13], {one,two,three}
- Multiple file upload on a single command line
- Custom maximum transfer rate
- Redirectable stderr
- Metalink support

- Version Number: 7.42.0

![Wget](http://www.linuxlinks.com/portal/content2/png/Wget1.png)

![Wget in action](http://www.linuxlinks.com/portal/content/reviews/Utilities/Screenshot-Wget.png)

Wget is open source software that retrieves content from web servers. Its name is derived from World Wide Web and get. It supports HTTP, HTTPS, and FTP protocols, as well as retrieval through HTTP proxies.

Wget can follow links in HTML pages and create local versions of remote web sites, fully recreating the directory structure of the original site. This is known as "recursive downloading."

Wget has been designed for robustness over slow or unstable network connections.

Features include:

- Resume aborted downloads, using REST and RANGE
- Use filename wild cards and recursively mirror directories
- NLS-based message files for many different languages
- Optionally converts absolute links in downloaded documents to relative, so that downloaded documents may link to each other locally
- Runs on most UNIX-like operating systems as well as Microsoft Windows
- Supports HTTP proxies
- Supports HTTP cookies
- Supports persistent HTTP connections
- Unattended / background operation
- Uses local file timestamps to determine whether documents need to be re-downloaded when mirroring

- Website: [www.gnu.org/software/wget/][3]
- Developer: Hrvoje Niksic, Gordon Matzigkeit, Junio Hamano, Dan Harkless, and many others
- License: GNU GPL v3
- Version Number: 1.16.3
