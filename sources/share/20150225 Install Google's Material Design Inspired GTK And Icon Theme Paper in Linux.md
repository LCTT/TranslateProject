================================================================================

[Paper][1] is a new upcoming GTK and icon theme inspired by Google’s [Material design][2] guidelines. It is developed by Sam Hewitt, the man behind [Moka Project][3]. Moka has always been in the list of [best themes for Ubuntu][4] and looking at Paper, I can say that once it is developed completely, it will surely be listed as one of the [best GTK themes][5].

Yes, you heard it right. The theme is still under development. Therefore I suggest that if you want to install Paper theme in Ubuntu or any other Linux distributions, do it only for experimentation purpose. You may see some broken icons here and there but the over all experience is nice.

### Install Paper theme in Ubuntu based distributions via PPA ###

Sam has a dedicated PPA for Ubuntu based distributions. I recommend that you use this PPA instead of downloading the theme because you’ll be getting the updates on the themes regularly. This PPA is available for Ubuntu 15.04, Ubuntu 14.10, Ubuntu 14.04, Elementary OS Freya, Elementary OS Luna, Linux Mint 17, Linux Mint 16 and other Linux distributions based on Ubuntu.

Open a terminal and use the following commands:

    sudo add-apt-repository ppa:snwh/pulp
    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install paper-gtk-theme paper-icon-theme

### Download Paper GTK and icon theme ###

If you do not want to use the PPA, you can download the themes and icons manually. As I said previously, you won’t get the updates automatically this way.

- [Download Paper icon themes][6]
- [Download Paper GTK themes][7]

#### Using Paper themes and icons ####

I hope that you know how to change or install themes in your respective Linux distributions. If you are not unaware of it, below are few tutorials that could help you to install new themes:

- [How to change themes in Ubuntu Unity][8]
- [How to change themes in GNOME Shell][9]
- [How to change themes in Linux Mint][10]
- [How to change theme in Elementary OS Freya][11]

#### Here is what Paper theme looks like ####

Since I am using [Elementary OS Freya][12] these days, here are some of the screenshots of how Paper theme and icons look like in Elementary OS Freya. I have used a wallpaper with Material design look so that it blends well with the icon and themes.
