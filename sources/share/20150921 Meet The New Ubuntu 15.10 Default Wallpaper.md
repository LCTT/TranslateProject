Meet The New Ubuntu 15.10 Default Wallpaper
================================================================================
**The brand new default wallpaper for Ubuntu 15.10 Wily Werewolf has been unveiled. **

At first glance you may find little has changed from the origami-inspired ‘Suru’ design shipped with April’s release of Ubuntu 15.04. But look closer and you’ll see that the new default background does feature some subtle differences.

For one it looks much lighter, helped by an orange glow emanating from the upper-left of the image. The angular folds and sections remain, but with the addition of blocky, rectangular sections.

The new background has been designed by Canonical Design Team member Alex Milazzo.

And just to show that there is a change, here is the Ubuntu 15.04 default wallpaper for comparison:

If you’re running daily builds of Ubuntu 15.10 Wily Werewolf and don’t yet see this as your default wallpaper you’ve no broken anything: the design has been unveiled but is, as of writing, yet to be packaged and uploaded to Wily itself.

You don’t have to wait until October to use the new design as your desktop background. You can download the wallpaper in a huge HiDPI display friendly 4096×2304 resolution by hitting the button below.

Finally, as we say this every time there’s a new wallpaper, you don’t have to care about the minutiae of distribution branding and design. If the new wallpaper is not to your tastes or you never keep it you can, as ever, easily change it — this isn’t the Ubuntu Phone after all!

**Are you a fan of the refreshed look? Let us know in the comments below. **
