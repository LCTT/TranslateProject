[Xtreme Download Manager][1], unarguably one of the [best download managers for Linux][2], has a new version named XDM 2015 which brings a fresh new look to it.

Xtreme Download Manager, also known as XDM or XDMAN, is a popular cross-platform download manager available for Linux, Windows and Mac OS X. It is also compatible with all major web browsers such as Chrome, Firefox, Safari enabling you to download directly from XDM when you try to download something in your web browser.

Applications such as XDM are particularly useful when you have slow/limited network connectivity and you need to manage your downloads. Imagine downloading a huge file from internet on a slow network. What if you could pause and resume the download at will? XDM helps you in such situations.

Some of the main features of XDM are:

- Pause and resume download
- [Download videos from YouTube][3] and other video sites
- Force assemble
- Download speed acceleration
- Schedule downloads
- Limit download speed
- Web browser integration
- Support for proxy servers

Here you can see the difference between the old and new XDM.
