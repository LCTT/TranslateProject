Super Tux Kart 0.9 Release Poster

SuperTuxKart 0.9 is a huge update over earlier versions, running a hot new engine (awesomely named ‘Antarctica’) under the hood that aims to deliver richer graphical environments , shading and depth of field plus better kart physics.

The bump in graphics performance necessitates a bump in graphics card requirements, too. SuperTuxKart developers advise would-be racers to will need a device with graphics comparable to (or, ideally, better than) Intel HD Graphics 3000, NVIDIA GeForce 8600 or AMD Radeon HD 3650.

### Other Changes ###

Keeping pace alongside the headline visual improvements in SuperTuxKart 0.9 is pair **brand new tracks**, new Karts, new online accounts for keeping track of and sharing badges earned through the **newly introduced achievements system**, and oodles of fixes and artwork tweaks.
