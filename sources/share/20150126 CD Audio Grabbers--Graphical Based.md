CD Audio Grabbers - Graphical Based
================================================================================
CD audio grabbers are designed to extract ("rip") the raw digital audio (in a format commonly called CDDA) from a compact disc to a file or other output. This type of software enables a user to encode the digital audio into a variety of formats, and download and upload disc info from freedb, an internet compact disc database.

Is copying CDs legal? Under US copyright law, converting an original CD to digital files for personal use has been cited as qualifying as 'fair use'. However, US copyright law does not explicitly allow or forbid making copies of a personally-owned audio CD, and case law has not yet established what specific scenarios are permitted as fair use. The copyright position is much clearer in the UK. From 2014 it become legal for UK citizens to make copies of CDs, MP3s, DVD, Blu-rays and e-books. This only applies if the individual owns the physical media being ripped, and the copy is made only for their own private use. For other countries in the European Union, member nations can allow a private copy exception too.

If you are not sure what the position is for the country you live in, please check your local copyright law to make sure that you are on the right side of the law before using the software featured in this two page article.

To some extent, it may seem a bit of a chore to rip CDs. Streaming services like Spotify and Google Play Music offer access to a huge library of music in a convenient form, and without having to rip your CD collection. However, if you already have a large CD collection, it is still desirable to be able to convert your CDs to enjoy on mobile devices like smartphones, tablets, and portable MP3 players.

This two page article highlights my favorite audio CD grabbers. I pick the best four graphical audio grabbers, and the best four console audio grabbers. All of the utilities are released under an open source license.

Audex is an easy to use open source audio CD ripping application. Whilst it is in a fairly early stage of development, this KDE desktop tool is stable, slick and simple to use.

The assistant is able to create profiles for LAME, OGG Vorbis (oggenc), FLAC, FAAC (AAC/MP4) and RIFF WAVE. Beyond the assistant you can define your own profile, which means, that Audex works together with commmand line encoders in general.

#### Features include:  ####

- Extract with CDDA Paranoia
- Extract and encode run parallel
- Filename editing with local and remote CDDB/FreeDB database
- Submit new entries to CDDB/FreeDB database
- Metadata correction tools like capitalize etc
- Multi-profile extraction (with one commandline-encoder per profile)
- Fetch covers from the internet and store them in the database
- Create playlists, cover and template-based-info files in target directory
- Create extraction and encoding protocols
- Transfer files to a FTP-server

ripperX is an open source graphical interface for ripping CD audio tracks and encoding them to Ogg, MP2, MP3, or FLAC formats. It's goal is to be easy to use, requiring only a few mouse clicks to convert an entire album. It supports CDDB lookups for album and track information.

It uses cdparanoia to convert (i.e. "rip") CD audio tracks to WAV files, and then calls the Vorbis/Ogg encoder oggenc to convert the WAV to an OGG file. It can also call flac to perform lossless compression on the WAV file, resulting in a FLAC file.

#### Features include:  ####

- Very simple to use
- Rip audio CD tracks into WAV, MP3, OGG, or FLAC files
- Supports CDDB lookups
- Supports ID3v2 tags
- Pause the ripping process
