Daily Ubuntu Tips–Things To Do After Installing Ubuntu
================================================================================
Many users from Windows find themselves stuck when starting out with Ubuntu. It’s a completely different from Windows and getting confortable with it may not be the easiest thing at first. Ubuntu is way different from Windows. The commands, the layout of the file system and application names are all foreign to many. But heck, we’re here to help.

If  you’re coming from Windows or Mac OS X and want to learn Ubuntu, you’re in the right place. We try to help new users get started with Ubuntu. Our slogan here is “**Tutorials for newbies**”, which is rightly so.

Most of our tutorials are not for pros. They are for people who are just starting out with Windows and Ubuntu. So, for all your Ubuntu needs, keep coming back.

Now, back to the topic.  One of our readers asked us this question few days ago.

> What should you do first after installing Ubuntu?

Simple. When you first install Ubuntu, there are many things you may want to get started with. But the most important thing is to get it right. Don’t worry about the difficult things, those you’ll learn later.

Here are the first few things you’ll want do after installing Ubuntu. There might be more, but these are important.

- Update your system – The very first thing is to update your system. Updating allows you to install newer packages and install fixes for other programs. The commands below will show you how to properly update your system when using Ubuntu.

    sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get dist-upgrade && sudo apt-get autoremove

- Another thing to do right after installing Ubuntu is to run the below command. This command helps you install codecs or packages that were left out of Ubuntu for legal reasons. Ubuntu comes without these important programs and they are very useful. Without them you may not be able to listen to music, watch movies and do other things. So, if you installed Ubuntu and can’t play some DVDs or listen to music CDs, then run the commands below.

    sudo apt-get install ubuntu-restricted-extras

The commands above are not the only commands you’ll run in Ubuntu, but they are few of the first you should run after installing Ubuntu. I hope this helps.

Enjoy!
