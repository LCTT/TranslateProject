This year openSUSE Summit will be held in the beautiful Florida, November 15 to 17 and the [Disney’s Coronado Springs Resort][2] will welcome all Geekos to this year’s event.

The openSUSE Travel Support Program provides travel sponsorships to individuals that want to attend openSUSE Summit and need financial assistance.

For Summit this year the TSP will work a bit differently. The TSP will make 2 calls, for the first call the deadline is October 3, 2013 and you can start sending your applications now! The results will be given before October 8, 2013.
The second call will start on October 11, 2013 ending on October 17, 2013. The results before October 22, 2013. Important to say that the second call is for those who had applied on [CfP][3] and didn’t have answer before the first call ends. Of course, even applied and no answer yet you can send your application on the first call.

About the TSP you can see at [https://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Travel_Support_Program][4] The instructions are detailed at [https://connect.opensuse.org/travel-support/][6]

*Suitcase*

Important

* A good application with good information will be processed faster.
* Always choose the most economical option whenever possible.  People who need travel sponsorship, should         look for the best price. If the Travel Committee finds a cheaper price, that will be the price in consideration.

In case of doubts just drop us an email travel-support@opensuse.org

Do not forget… The [Call for Participation][7] still opened so hurry up!
