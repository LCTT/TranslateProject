6 Unusual Yet Great Linux Operating Systems For Your Netbook!
================================================================================
> The beauty of Linux-based operating systems is that they can be customised as per the requirements. So, here we present top 6 unusual yet interesting distros for netbooks! 

A good netbook operating system is one that can fully utilise its resources. The memory usage should be minimal when it is on the idle mode and as the screen is smaller, you need to have a very good navigation system to avoid cluttering the screen.

And what better for a Linux enthusiast than having a netbook optimised operating system, based on open source technology.

1.**AntiX** – This utilises the iceWM window manager that assists in keeping the initial memory footprint low. Although it’s not as stylish as Ubuntu, Mint or Elementary, it is fully functional. There is a taskbar for navigation at the bottom and icons on the desktop that has been standard across operating systems over a number of years. AntiX is accompanied with an array of applications with a few that won’t necessarily fit well with a netbook.

2. **SparkyLinux** - The appearance and feel of Razor-Qt is extremely traditional and comes with a panel at the bottom and a menu in the bottom left corner. SparkyLinux is accompanied with an array of applications. The developers once again have plumped for the LibreOffice suite over the lighter Abiword and Gnumeric tools.

3. **Lubuntu** - The LXDE desktop is extremely light and nearly as easy to customise as Xubuntu. The desktop is quite familiar having a panel at the bottom with a menu and system tray icons. However, you can customise Lubuntu to appear the way you want it to with multiple panels if you so wish. The applications are quite well adapted to a netbook with the Sylpheed email client, the Firefox web browser as well as Abiword and Gnumeric.

4. **OS4** – This is based on Xubuntu. It makes use of the XFCE desktop that is wonderful for customizing and can work any way you want it to. XFCE being a lightweight desktop environment performs grealty on a netbook. However, you will need to install the restricted extras package to get Flash videos and MP3s to play but with OS4 these things work straight away. It comes with a Commodore Amiga Emulator installed so if you like to retro game on your netbook this is definitely an option.

5. **Point Linux** – This is unique as it uses the MATE desktop. The MATE desktop was initially taken from Gnome 2 but it has evolved to be a really good desktop environment in its own right. Point Linux appears quite stylish. The menus appear great and the performance on the netbook is really good. Similar to LXDE and XFCE desktops, it is highly customizable. Point Linux comes with four virtual workspaces by default allowing you to use these again to maximize the usage of your netbook so that it is limited by memory and processor power over display issues.

6. **Elementary OS** – This is great if you are looking for something very stylish. It doesn’t have an office suite on installation but you have the option to pick and select tools you want to use. For web browsing you have Midori and the email client is Geary. It comes installed with Totem for viewing movies and the audio application is a compact tool called Noise.
