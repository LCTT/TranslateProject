LinuxCon/CloudOpen Goose Chase Ends in Tie for Grand Prize
================================================================================
Hundreds of people raced to the finish in the first-ever LinuxCon/CloudOpen Goose Chase. From showing your cowsay to the coffee cup that fuels your Linux work, you - the community - showcased your competitive nature and passion for having fun. The competiton was fierce through the end, which resulted in a tie for Grand Prize for Round Two (round one wrapped up in October, and the [winners were announced][1] at LinuxCon and CloudOpen North America). Because there are two Grand Prize winners, we will not be awarding a First Prize.

The winners of Round Two are:

**Grand Prize: $500 Amazon Gift Card**

**Daniel German**, Canada

**Joao Paulo Rechi Vita**, Brazil

"I participated in the Goose Chase at LinuxCon North America and found it really fun, so when I was showing the pictures to my girlfriend back home I found the {online} Goose Chase and decided to join it as well. And as I expected, {it} was a lot of fun again, specially because this time some of the missions needed quite a bit of creativity to be accomplished."

**Second Prize, $50 Amazon Gift Card**

**Madalina-Ioana Alexe**, Romania

Madalina-Ioana works for Intel Romania on Tizen and attended the Gluster Community Day this week at LinuxCon Europe. 

"I found it is a fun game, which is still suitable for geeks. It was a nice and funny experience and I found out that there are even more geeks like me."

Congratulations to all our winners and thank you so much for participating in the Goose Chase!
