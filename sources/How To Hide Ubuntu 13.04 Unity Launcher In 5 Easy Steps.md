How To Hide Ubuntu 13.04 Unity Launcher In 5 Easy Steps
================================================================================
For last couple of days, I was exploring and learning about conky. While capturing its screen-shots, I got stuck with a repetitive task of cropping out unity launcher from the screen-shots. Suddenly, I asked myself — is there a way through which the unity launcher can be made hidden by default (i.e., it appears only when needed)? I googled around and found that it can be easily done through an option system settings. So, today, I’ll not be discussing a particular application but a useful how-to that will definitely be very helpful to other Ubuntu users.

**Important**

I also thought to reposition the unity launcher at the bottom of the desktop (like you have it in Apple’s Mac), but read that it is not possible to reposition the launcher in Ubuntu from 12.04 onwards. Just like many other users, I was also a bit disappointed. Anyway, if you want to read more on this, you can read this [detailed discussion on Ubuntu Forums][1].

Share with us if you have known any unofficial way (an app or a plugin??) to reposition the unity launcher in Ubuntu 13.04.
