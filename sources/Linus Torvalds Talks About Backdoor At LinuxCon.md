Linuxcon conference was held in New Orleans on Thursday September 19 and **Linus Torvalds** was present in this linux conference. The father of the Linux kernel joined fellow kernel developers in answering a barrage of questions about Linux development. Also, part of the linux development kernel panel was **Tejun Heo, Sarah Sharp** and **Greg Kroah-HartMan**. The panel was moderated by Ric Wheeler who works at Red Hat as the senior manager of the kernel file and storage team.

Ric asked many questions to the linux development kernel panel and one of the question was whether a government agency had ever asked about inserting a back-door into Linux. This question was made at the 25-th minute and the panel went completely silent. Oww! What now? What does this silence mean? Did the panel let the silence talk for them?

Then suddenly a long ‘No’ was heard. It was Linus Torvald’s answer. He laughed while answering this serious question that every linux user cares about. Then he repeated ‘no’ in a serious way. Now, what does this mean, ‘No’ like ‘No’ or ‘No’ like ‘Yes’? Do you think NSA has backdoors inside linux? I dont think so, but i want to know your opinion in the comments. Please share this article with other linux users and do not forget to watch the video, words can not describe what you can see.
