Linux Top 3: Shuttleworth Leaves Upstart, Arch Assaults Security and Android x86 4.4
================================================================================
#### 1) Shuttleworth on Upstart ####

Finding the successor to init has been an interesting debate in recent years, but it is now clear who the winner is and it's not Upstart. Last week, Debian voted in favor of systemd and now Ubuntu has followed suit.

> "I know the many people who work on Upstart appreciated the high praise for its code quality, rigorous testing and clarity of purpose expressed even by members who voted against it; from my perspective, it has been a pleasure to support the efforts of people who want to create truly great free software, and do it properly," Mark Shuttleworth wrote in a [blog post][1]. " Upstart has served Ubuntu extremely well – it gave us a great competitive advantage at a time when things became very dynamic in the kernel, it’s been very stable (it is after all the init used in both Ubuntu and RHEL 6 ;) and has set a high standard for Canonical-lead software quality of which I am proud."

#### 2) Arch Assault ####

A new Arch based security distribution is now surfacing, for penetration testers.

> "The ArchAssault Project is an Arch Linux derivative for penetration testers, security professionals and all-around Linux enthusiasts," the main [project page states][2]."We aim to give you everything you love about Arch Linux but designed around the needs and wants of security professionals."

Arch Assault isn't just for x86 either, there is also support for ARMv6h and ARMv7h.

#### 3) Android x86 4.4 ####

While desktop type distros like Arch continue to make inroads into ARM, Android, which is essentially an ARM Linux distro is going the other way.

> "The 4.4-RC1 release is based on the Android 4.4.2 (KitKat-MR1 release)," the project page [states][3]. "We have fixed and added x86 specified code to let the system runs smoothly on x86 platforms, especially for netbooks or tablets. "
