SuperTuxKart 0.8.1 Release Candidate Revved Up And Ready for Testing
================================================================================
**Hands up if you don’t like open-source racing game SuperTuxKart? You, folks, are strange.**

As kart-racers go, it’s one of the most popular freely available. And for good reason: it’s fun, easy to play and has a dedicated team of developers who are continually adding to and improving what is already a really polished game.

But it’s getting even better. The first release candidate of build 0.8.1 – the first update since last year’s 0.8 build – [has been made available for testing][1] (for ‘testing’ see ‘excuse to play it for hours and not feel guilty’).

SuperTuxKart 0.8.1 adds a number of improvements, including:

- A new Star Trek themed track “STK Enterprise”
- Three tracks updated (‘Old Mines’, ‘Lighthouse’ & ‘Zen Garden’)
- New ‘Egg Hunt’ and ‘Soccer’ modes
- New and updated karts
- New difficulty level
- Bubblegum shield weapon
- Option to save and resume Grand Prix mode 
- [WiiMote Support][2]

### Geting SuperTuxKart 0.8.1 ###

No release date has been given on when to expect the final, stable release of 0.8.1 but I’d expect it to land sometime in December – marking one year from the previous release in the 0.8.x series.

In the meantime, if you’re okay with “Release Candidate”-quality software, you’ll find a pre-compiled binary for Linux over on the project’s Sourceforge Page.
