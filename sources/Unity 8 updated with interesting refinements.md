Unity 8 updated with interesting refinements
================================================================================
[Unity 8][1] is the next-generation Unity aimed at and being developed in mind with Ubuntu converged, Unity 8 that is to deliver beauty, power and professional designs for phones, tablets and desktops.

Unity 8 has been updated to yet-another meaningful release, optimizing its elements with more clarity and natural behaviors.

Weeks ago, Unity 8 received support for the carousel effect in the Videos scope, carousel item-listing shortly after adopted by the Music scope, basically, Unity 8 featuring coverflow manners of rendering and organizing content in its Videos and Music scopes.

The latest Unity 8 version brings refinements for the **coverflow** effect used by the Music scope, rendering their covers (the big-sized thumbnails generated by music tracks) with a subtly-refined shape.

Opening the Music scope, the user is to notice the new shape used by the cycled-through covers featuring a more square look, increasing their width and decreasing their height; the result: the covers have now more elegance, emanating style and class, moreover, being now visually aligned with the other thumbnails from (for example) the `Albums` category (featuring the same look & feel).

Unity 8 comes with several search areas, search areas enriched with support for activity indicators; typing now a term in the search area, displays a vivid extremely-energetic spinning circle, transmitting to the user its in-progress state.
