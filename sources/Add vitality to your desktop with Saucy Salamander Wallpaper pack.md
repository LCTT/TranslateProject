采用Saucy Salamander墙面壁纸包为你的桌面添加活力
================================================================================
On October 17th 2013, Ubuntu 13.10 will be released, marking yet-another exciting version of the powerful modern operating system, OS packed with features, improvements, as well as with new wallpapers generated by the fruitful submission contest and the landing of the default wallpaper.

**Saucy Salamander Wallpaper** is a set of wallpapers centering the vivid salamander into a simplistic, minimalist environment.

Essentially, the bundle of wallpapers locates a white-ish salamander on top of an orange background, while adding class to the basic wallpaper via the four white corners, surrounding the salmander actor inside the desktop.

The result: the eye is pleased and non-disturbed, while the orange background pushes a warm tone into the Dash's texture.
