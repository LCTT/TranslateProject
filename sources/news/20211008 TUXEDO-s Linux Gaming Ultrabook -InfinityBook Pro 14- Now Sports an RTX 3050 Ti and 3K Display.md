TUXEDO’s Linux Gaming Ultrabook “InfinityBook Pro 14” Now Sports an RTX 3050 Ti and 3K Display
======

Tuxedo has recently unveiled its latest and exciting revision to its InfinityBook Pro 14. Despite weighing just around one kg, this sleek-looking ultrabook packs in impressive specs and can pretty much run various AAA games. Let’s take a look at what this laptop has to offer.

### Updated Specifications

#### Processor Upgrade

The refreshed offering has updated the processors to high-performance **Intel Core i5-11300H and Core i7-11370H** instead of the power-saving chips in the previous iteration.

In case you didn’t know, the performance-oriented chips can utilize up to 60 watts (TDP) to provide you the enhanced performance.

#### New-Gen RTX Graphics

As for the graphics side, you’ll find NVIDIA’s mid-range **GeForce RTX 3050 Ti** along with the integrated Iris Xe graphics. This is a power-efficient MaxQ variant that promises a TGP of 35 watts.

Considering this as a mid-tier GPU, it should be enough for gaming with 1080p settings.

Do note there are no 3050ti available in the market separately. It is currently limited to OEMs/laptops.

This graphics card is very beneficial for gamers on the go as it supports NVIDIA’s DLSS, like all RTX GPUs, for a stepped-up gaming experience.

Also, it’s never been a better time because Linux gamers can now [enable DLSS for DX11/12 and Vulkan-based games like Cyberpunk 2077][2].

### Other Features

If you’re worried about cooling, fret not. The laptop comes with an all-new cooling system that contains two heat pipes and two fans. Thus, working under heavy workloads is no longer an issue.

As for the storage and memory, two M.2 NVME SSD slots and dual-channel RAM up to 64 GB can be seen.

The I/O ports include an HDMI 2.0, USB-C 3.2 Gen2, two USB-A 3.2 Gen1 ports, an SD card reader, and a Thunderbolt 4 port.

Finally, a large **53 Wh battery** is also included that ensures 12 hours (idle) of runtime. This is pretty helpful to that stunning 14 inch **Omnia 3K IPS display.**

### Availability and Pricing

The InfinityBook Pro 14 **starts at 1180 EUR** and goes all the way **up to 1770 EUR** if you need the 3K Omnia display and Core i7-11370H.

Preorders have already started from Oct 6th. You can head to its official website to explore more about the product and its availability.

### Wrapping Up

This is one beast of an ultrabook that doubles as a gaming laptop. However, I don’t understand the inclusion of 3050ti with a 3K display. So, if you are looking for other options, I would suggest [exploring other places to buy Linux laptops][4].

Users frequently on the go will find this laptop useful for both work and play, thanks to the laptop’s weight and power.
