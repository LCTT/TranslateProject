SparkyLinux 6.0 Release is based on Debian 11 and Includes a Built-in VPN
======

SparkyLinux 6.0 is a major stable update that utilizes Debian 11 ‘Bullseye’ as its base now.

While you can go through the [features of Debian 11][1], SparkyLinux 6.0 should reflect some of the perks associated with it.

Here, we shall take a quick look at what SparkyLinux 6.0 has to offer.

### SparkyLinux 6.0 “Po Tolo”: What’s New?

The major highlight of the release is the latest Debian 11 ‘Bullseye’ as its base. The repositories have also been updated to get the latest packages.

SparkyAPTus AppCenter has replaced the original SparkyAPTus, which is no longer developed.

You can install, reinstall, and remove applications easily. Not just limited to the applications, but you also get the ability to tweak the pre-configured desktops using it.

In addition to that, you can remove and install Linux Kernels as well. You can choose from Debian Kernel, Liquorix, Sparky, and XanMod.

It is worth noting that you will still be able to access all the tools from the old APTus.

To enhance privacy and security, SparkyLinux has decided to include the non-profit [RiseUp VPN][4] application pre-installed.

It is a VPN service that relies on donations to keep the network alive and comes with cross-platform support. You can also find it available for Android devices.

So, this makes it an interesting addition to the distribution. If you are not using any VPN service, this should make things easy.

The FirstRun app has been replaced with an improved welcome app that guides you through some basic pointers.

### Other Improvements

With the latest release, you can also find new wallpapers and updated application packages that include:

  * Thunderbird 78.13.0
  * VLC 3.0.16
  * LibreOffice 7.0.4
  * Calamares Installer 3.2.41.1



To know more about the release, you can refer to the [official announcement][6].

### Download Sparky 6.0

SparkyLinux 6.0 is available to download with Xfce and KDE Plasma desktop environments. It supports 32-bit systems as well, which is a good thing.

If you are already running SparkLinux “Po Tolo” rolling release, you need to update your system to get Sparky 6.0.

Do note that the rolling version will switch to a stable release. So, if you want to stay on the rolling release, you need to wait for a few days.
