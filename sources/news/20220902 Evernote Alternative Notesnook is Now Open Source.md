Evernote Alternative Notesnook is Now Open Source
======
Notesnook is a new privacy-focused note-taking app that decided to go open-source.

![Evernote Alternative Notesnook is Now Open Source][1]

What comes to mind when you think about an open-source secure note-taking application?

Probably [Standard Notes][2]**.**

🔒 It is an open-source, end-to-end encrypted app. And also happens to be one of the best note-taking apps for Linux users:

[Here Are The Best Note Apps For Linux We Found For You][3]

However, there are fewer privacy-focused alternatives to Standard Notes that provide features similar to the popular **Evernote** note-taking app.

Fortunately, we have a new option to join the list, i.e., **Notesnook**.

📢 Notesnook recently went open-source under GPLv3 license to allow the community to help improve it and make sure the project does not go anywhere.

Currently, the developers want to focus on improving the GitHub repository, and then move on to add new features/other development activities.

### Notesnook: What Does It Offer?

![notesnook][5]

Notesnook is an open-source zero knowledge notes storage platform with end-to-end encryption.

Similar to Standard Notes, you can use it for free or opt for the premium plan to unlock a few more perks. Some highlights include:

* App lock for mobile.
* Private notes vault.
* Password protected note sharing.
* Cross-platform.

The interface looks like a mix of everything useful. I will be interested to take a look at it separately as a review or maybe for a comparison, sounds good, right?

It is available for Windows, mac, and Linux. You can download an AppImage file, or .deb/.rpm for the Linux desktop.

🏷️💲 **To celebrate going open-source**, Notesnook is also offering up to **75% discount** on its [yearly premium plan][6] backed with a 30-day money-back guarantee. You can give it a try and see if you want the premium plan.

As someone checking out the offering from India, I see an **80% discount**, making it just **$10** for a year of subscription. It can be different for other regions.

Explore its [GitHub page][7] or the [official website][8] to know more. Additionally, you can read their [blog post][9] on why they decided to go open-source.
