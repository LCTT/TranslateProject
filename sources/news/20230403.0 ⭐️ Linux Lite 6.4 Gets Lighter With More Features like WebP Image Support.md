Linux Lite is known for its lightweight and Windows-like layout that provides users with a familiar operating system experience.

The last major release, [Linux Lite 6.2][3] saw the inclusion of various user interface tweaks/bug fixes, and now another release is here that also has various improvements on offer.

Let me take you through the Linux Lite 6.4 release.

### 🆕 Linux Lite 6.4: What's New?

Based on **[Ubuntu 22.04.2 LTS][5]**, this release has some interesting new additions, here are the highlights that you should know about:

- **SystemD reporting via Lite System Report**
- **ZSTD Compression**
- **Better WebP Support**
- **Updated Thunderbird**
- **Xfce 4.18**

#### SystemD reporting via Lite System Report

As you know that **systemd is one of the basic building blocks of a Linux system** that starts the boot procedure for the rest of the system.

Linux Lite 6.4 has bought about a dedicated reporting option for systemd errors. This will make it easy to pinpoint booting and general system issues via the Lite System Report tool.

#### ZSTD Compression

The complete Lite app suite (their in-house apps) has been repackaged using ZSTD compression for faster decompression and better compression, resulting in a **lighter storage footprint**.

For example: Now the Lite Themes app is **76.8 MB** instead of the more hefty **91.2 MB**.

Systems with slower processors will benefit a great deal due to the inclusion of this, resulting in significantly faster application update times.

#### Better WebP Support

The Thunar file manager has been **updated to****4.16.10** and can now show thumbnails for WebP files correctly, instead of a generic placeholder image.

This should make it easy for you to go through your WebP files, without the need to open them one-by-one.

#### Updated Thunderbird
