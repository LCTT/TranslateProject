#### New Game Sources

One of the eye-catching features is the use of **Epic Games Store** as a game source. Although Epic Games doesn’t have an official client for Linux, the Lutris developers have found an (unofficial) way. One just needs to connect their account and the game library will pop up.

This will be will very convenient for Linux gamers who own games from Epic Games Store and don’t have to rely on [downloading the Epic Games client][4] using the community installer.

Also, the **Dolphin Emulator** is now listed as a game source. Nintendo GameCube and Wii games will now be automatically added to Lutris if they’re stored in the local database.

#### AMD FidelityFX Super Resolution &amp; DLSS Support

Playing heavy and demanding games is now easier thanks to AMD’s open-source FSR. It is a technology that helps you get better performance in games without adversely affecting the quality.

In addition to that, Lutris also adds support for NVIDIA’s DLSS that enhances visual quality along with frame rates of a game with RTX graphics cards.

Do note that FSR will be available as an option for only compatible Wine versions with Lutris.

  * 3rd party services like GOG, Humble Bundle, Epic Games Store can now be enabled or disabled from the preferences
