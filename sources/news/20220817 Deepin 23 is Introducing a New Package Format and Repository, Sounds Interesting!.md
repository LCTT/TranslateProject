Deepin 23 is Introducing a New Package Format and Repository, Sounds Interesting!
======
deepin 23 will be an interesting upgrade with a couple of fundamental changes. What do you think?

![deepin 23][1]

Deepin remains one of the most [beautiful Linux distributions][2] out there.

While the entire user experience may not be hassle-free, it certainly looks good. The developers of deepin have experimented with intriguing customizations that make it stand out from the crowd.

If you are learning about it for the first time, you should know that it is one of the [interesting distributions based on Debian Linux][3].

With [deepin 20][4] and its recent point releases, we had a nice list of upgrades. Now, it looks like **deepin 23** will be the next major upgrade.

### Deepin 23 Preview: What’s New?

![deepin 23][5]

Deepin 23 preview has been made available for testing. Unlike its previous version, deepin 23 includes some fundamental upgrades that impact the user experience on several levels.

The key highlights include:

* A new package format.
* A new idea for system updates.
* A new repository.
* New wallpapers.
* [Linux Kernel 5.18][6].

### New Package Format: Linglong

![][7]

**Linglong** is the new package format developed by deepin.

It aims at solving various compatibility problems caused by complex dependencies of traditional package formats under Linux. Furthermore, reducing security risks by supporting sandboxing along with incremental updates and privacy protection.

You can find the packages on its [Linglong store][8] as of now.

Do we need another package format? I don’t think so.

With Flatpak and Snap around, it does not sound like anything that’s never been done before.

To me, it looks like deepin simply wants to have its own package format as part of its offerings.

### Atomic Updates

The system updates will be treated as atomic operations, i.e., that when packages are successfully installed, the update completes. If the installation fails, the system can be reverted to the previous version with no changes.

So, you get system rollback support after an upgrade and can avoid difficulties with partial upgrades.

### Independent Upstream

While it is based on Debian, deepin aims to have a separate repository for the core packages and some optional components.

For the preview release, the developers mention that they intend to learn from the upstream like Debian and Arch Linux to improve their repository.

### New Wallpapers

![deepin 23][9]

Like every other major release, deepin 23 adds some refreshing wallpapers and new default wallpaper.

### Download Deepin 23 Preview

Note that Deepin 23 stable is not yet available. So, if you want to experiment on your test system, and experience what’s in store for you, try the preview version.

You can find the download links to the ISO file in the [official announcement post][10].
