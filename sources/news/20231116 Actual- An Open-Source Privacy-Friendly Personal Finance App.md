Actual: An Open-Source Privacy-Friendly Personal Finance App
======
A fairly new open-source finance app with privacy in mind.
Earlier last year, Actual, a personal finance app, decided to [open-source][1] its source code in a bid to ensure the continuation of its development.

Back then, the main reason behind that move was that **the lead developer was unable to juggle between a full-time job and the 'Actual' project** , even hiring people had to be ruled out owing to cost concerns.

For those unfamiliar, Actual is a privacy-focused app that allows you to manage your personal finances by providing you with **a neat user interface** and **seamless syncing across devices**.

With this article, we shall see how Actual operates now, and what kind of functionality is on offer.

Let's dig in!

### A Super Fast Open-Source Finance App

Actual primarily uses **TypeScript** and **JavaScript** as its foundation, with a hint of C++/C here and there. Going open has allowed a lot of its previous features to stay intact, and even made way for various improvements over them.

Some **key feature highlights** include:

  * **Easy transaction tracking.**
  * **Fine-tuned for fast performance.**
  * **Dedicated budgeting options.**
  * **Intuitive reporting of transactions.**



There is even support for **optional end-to-end encryption** , **multi-device sync** , **importing of transactions** from popular financial file formats, and more.

Of course, the ability to generate reports should be helpful for everyone who decides to manage personal finance using the app:

Unfortunately, you do not get an option to use any official hosted instance. So, it will be **a completely self-hostable experience** (cloud or local).

That is not entirely a bad thing, though, as **many privacy-conscious users swear by self-hosting apps** to get the most secure experience possible. Sure, if you have never self-hosted services, you might want to explore its documentation first.

Actual also has a neat option where **you can[ **instantly deploy**][4] it on PikaPods**, pricing starts at **$1.4 per month**.

In a nutshell, your data should remain secure if you use a local-first personal finance app like Actual.

📋

You can refer to the [official documentation][6] to get started with self-hosting on the cloud or locally on your computer.

Furthermore, since going open, **Actual has been receiving a steady flow of updates.**

The recent [Actual 23.11.0][7] release came in with **s** tability improvements, tweaks, and bug fixes.

I even checked out Actual's GitHub repo, and the commit activity has been pretty good ever since it landed on GitHub. See for yourself. 👇

I am glad to see that the contributors for Actual can pull this off quite gracefully by regularly pushing updates that matter.

If you are **interested in trying out Actual** , then you can visit its [official website][9] or try out the [live demo][10]. For those who want to **contribute to the code** , I highly suggest you head over to the [GitHub repo][11] to get started.

I think that Actual can be a great contender for our [best open-source accounting software][12] list.
