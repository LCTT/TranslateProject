Pop!_OS 22.04 Linux Distro is Finally Adding Raspberry Pi 4 Support
======
System76 is finally adding Raspberry Pi 4 support for its latest Pop!_OS 22.04 LTS.

![pop os][1]

Pop!_OS is one of the [best beginner-friendly Linux distributions][2].

It is based on Ubuntu, and obviously, Pop!_OS 22.04 LTS is based on [Ubuntu 22.04 LTS][3].

However, unlike Ubuntu, Pop!_OS 22.04 did not officially support Raspberry Pi at the time of release.

So, it only makes sense to expect for Raspberry Pi support with [Pop!_OS 22.04 LTS][4] release.

If you recall, System76 added support for Raspberry Pi with **Pop!_OS 21.10** for the first time. We also [reported][5] it while it was being tested.

And, it looks like System76’s latest Pop!_OS release is now gearing up to support Raspberry Pi 4, as revealed by System76’s Principal Engineer **Jeremy Soller.**

### Pop!_OS 22.04 LTS for Raspberry Pi 4

This is excellent news for you if you have been hanging in with Pop!_OS 21.10 on your Raspberry Pi 4.

And, for anyone wanting to try Pop!_OS on Raspberry Pi 4, we will finally be getting an LTS edition for it.

As of now, the ISO is available as a **tech preview**. So, you should expect bugs and usability issues if you would like to take it for a test drive. Note that this is **only limited to Raspberry Pi 4** and does not support other Raspberry Pi devices, which is a bummer.

We do not know if System76 plans to support other Raspberry Pi boards for this LTS release, or if they stick to Raspberry Pi 4.

However, considering Raspberry Pi 4 is pretty popular nowadays, it should be a good development for many tinkerers out there seeking an [alternative operating system for Raspberry Pi][6] replacing Ubuntu.

With Pop!_OS 22.04 LTS, Raspberry Pi 4 users should be able to experience some of the most exciting upgrades along with a newer [Linux Kernel 5.15 LTS][7].

To download the tech preview, head to Pop!_OS’s **[official website][8]**and click on the download button to find the option:
