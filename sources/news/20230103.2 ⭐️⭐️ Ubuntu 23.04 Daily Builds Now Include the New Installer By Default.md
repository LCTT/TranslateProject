Ubuntu 23.04 Daily Builds Now Include the New Installer By Default
======

Ubuntu 23.04 may finally feature the new installer! See it here!

![Ubuntu 23.04 Daily Builds Now Include the New Installer By Default][1]

In **February 2021**, the Ubuntu development team [revealed][2] their plans for a new installer to use [Flutter][3] at its core.

We covered the news and eagerly waited for it to arrive in an Ubuntu build:

After almost two years of development, the new installer for Ubuntu seems to be the default included in the latest pending daily builds.

Thanks to [Phoronix][4] for spotting it, which piqued my interest to check it out.

Let me take you through the new installer for Ubuntu.

> ℹ️ Ubuntu Daily Builds are subject to change. So, what you see now may not be available tomorrow.

### Here's How the New Installer Looks

![ubuntu new installer][5]

When you begin the installation, you are greeted by a '[Kudu][6]' (_Ubuntu 22.10's mascot_) and the option to select the language. Considering it is a daily build, a Lobster mascot icon should soon appear throughout the platform.

The option to select what Ubuntu experience you want has received a few tweaks and now looks cleaner.

You can also expect to see a "**Repair"** option in this selection menu if you already have Ubuntu 23.04 installed on your system. I'm not sure if that is the case, but it was something planned initially.

![ubuntu new installer advanced features][8]

When I continued the setup, I noticed that support for [OpenZFS][9] had been dropped. Instead, I could only opt for [LVM][10].

They could have provided a different option, such as **btrfs**, so that users could quickly set their systems up with it instead of doing it later.

![ubuntu new installer timezone selector][11]

Although the timezone selector is mostly the same, a few tweaks are made here and there.

![ubuntu new installer user config][12]

The '_Who are you_' screen is now more intuitive and contains all the useful options.

![ubuntu new installer theme selector][13]

This new addition to the Ubuntu installer lets you select the theme immediately, which is refreshing to see 😌

![ubuntu new installer progress][14]

The installation progress screen is about the same, with a modern touch and a new terminal view button.

![ubuntu new installer installation complete][15]

At the end of the installation process, a new end screen is shown with options to either restart Ubuntu or shut down.

**The overall install experience has been upgraded to current standards, which makes it more appealing, providing a modern user experience.**

Unfortunately, you will have to wait a bit more for Ubuntu 23.04's release or at least its beta release to get your hands on to properly test it out without risking encountering bugs.

Of course, unless you want to experiment with the [daily builds available][16], feel free to explore the download page.
