Ubuntu 18.04 is Reaching End of Life: Here's What You Can Do
======

Ubuntu 18.04 is reaching end of life soon. Here's what you need to know.

![ubuntu 18.04 end of life][1]

The iconic Ubuntu 18.04 'Bionic Beaver' release was a release that offered many improvements and features.

But like most good things, this, too, has reached an end (for most).

**What's Happening:** In March, Canonical announced that Ubuntu 18.04 would reach end-of-life (EOL) on **31 May 2023,** completing its 5 years of planned update cycle.

Well, that day is approaching fast, with just a few weeks to go.

**So, what does EOL mean?**

For a [Long-Term Version][2] Ubuntu release, it will stop **getting maintenance updates and security fixes.**

**So, what should you do now?**

If you are an enterprise or want to stick to Ubuntu 18.04, Canonical suggests you opt for [Ubuntu Pro][3], which will **extend support for Ubuntu 18.04 until April 2028**.

> 📋 Remember that only x86, x64, and arm64 architectures are supported via Ubuntu Pro.

Ubuntu Pro includes the full security patching treatment thanks to Expanded Security Maintenance (ESM) with 24/7 phone and ticket support.

Fret not; there is a [free plan for Ubuntu Pro][4] if you need it for personal or non-commercial use, giving you **10 years of security updates** from the date of its original release.

In either case, you could upgrade to the [Ubuntu 20.04][5] LTS release or do a fresh install of [Ubuntu 22.04][6] LTS if you want the latest and greatest Ubuntu LTS release,

Here's a handy guide to help you on your upgrade/reinstall journey.

If you do not have Ubuntu Pro and do not get extended maintenance updates, you should upgrade as soon as possible, else your system will remain vulnerable to security issues.

_💬 Will you be upgrading or opting for Ubuntu Pro subscription to get extended updates?_
