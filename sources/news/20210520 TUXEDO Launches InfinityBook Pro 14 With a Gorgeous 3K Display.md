TUXEDO Launches InfinityBook Pro 14 With a Gorgeous 3K Display
======

TUXEDO computers is popularly known for their [Linux laptops][1]. 

It looks like they have unveiled something exciting after a while that sports a gorgeous 3K res display with a 16:10 aspect ratio.

While that sounds good on paper, let me briefly highlight what it offers.

### InfinityBook Pro 14 with 3K Omnia Display

The key highlight of this release seems to be the 3K display, which should definitely provide you a crisp viewing experience with a much-requested 16:10 aspect ratio.

It is the first laptop by TUXEDO computers that focuses on a great display without ignoring the rest of the spec sheet.

The announcement mentions that the display panel is optimized for energy savings as well, even though it is not an IPS panel:

> The InfinityBook Pro 14 Gen6 features an **LTPS display**: It is characterized by **particular energy-savings** without affecting the brightness level. Nevertheless, it delivers a **higher resolution** than conventional TFT displays.

While it provides an extended vertical view, it could prove to be a good choice for multitaskers and productivity-focused users for an improved workflow.

Not just limited to that, the screen also comes equipped with 90 Hz refresh rates. So, this should make your experience smooth and gives you a chance to experience games with great frame rates.

However, you will not find an NVIDIA/AMD GPU powered variant, which is a bummer.

The screen offers 400 nits of brightness, which is perfectly fine for indoor use. If it was at least 500, I would have been impressed, personally.

Other important highlights may include a lightweight design and build, weighing just 1 kg, the latest Intel processor family, good battery backup claims (up to 12 hour), and room for two NVMe SSDs.

Overall, the specifications on paper mention:

  * IPS (2K variant) and LTPS (3K) display
  * i5/i7 11th gen mobile processors
  * Intel Xe Graphics
  * Up to 64 GB DDR4 3200 MHz RAM
  * Thunderbolt 4
  * Bluetooth 5.1
  * USB-C and USB 3.2 ports
  * 53 Wh lithium-ion battery
  * Full size SD card reader



### Pricing and Availability

It is currently available to pre-order with first deliveries starting from May 31, 2021. While it not exactly a cheap laptop, the base configuration starts at **1249 EUR,** which includes a 2K 16:10 display, i5 chip, 8 GB RAM, a 250 GB Samsung 970 Evo Plus SSD.

Of course, you can customize the configuration, and it offers a 2-year warranty coverage.
By default, it comes loaded with TUXEDO OS based on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS, but you can opt for the official Ubuntu 20.04 LTS as your operating system.

On average, it will take about 3 weeks to assemble when in stock. You can pre-order it now from the official website.
