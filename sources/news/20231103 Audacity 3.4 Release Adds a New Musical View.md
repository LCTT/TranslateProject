Continuing the trend is the recently introduced **Audacity 3.4** release, here with some new features and bug fixes.

## 🆕 Audacity 3.4: What's New?

![][3]

As a point release, this release has some important new features to offer, such as:

  * **New Musical View**
  * **Better Exporting**
  * **New Time Stretching Feature**



### New Musical View

![][4]

A new “ **Beats and measures grid** ” musical view has been added to Audacity that allows you to **easily align audio clips according to the tempo and rhythm of a project**.

The grid shows subdivisions of each measure according to the zoom level, and the clips can also be snapped to the nearest beat.

📋

You can access this by right-clicking anywhere on the ruler and selecting “Beats and Measures”.

### Better Exporting

![][5]

The exporter has been revamped, and now gives you **all the options in a single window** , that includes **a native file browser** , **format selection** , **audio options** and even **advanced options for 5.1 surround exports**.

### Time Stretching Feature

![][6]

It is now possible to **change the duration of audio clips without harming the pitch** of it.

This was thanks to the implementation of a **new time stretching algorithm** that has been tailored for music. The developers claim that it **outperforms many commercially available options**.

📋

Just hold the 'Alt' (for macOS: Option) button while hovering over the top third of a clip edge to start stretching.

### 🛠️ Other Changes

Other than that, here are some other notable changes:

  * In-built **support for[ **Opus**][7]**.
  * The **project sample rate doesn't change** randomly when importing audio.
