**Canonical has just released the first daily images for Ubuntu 14.10 (Utopic Unicorn) and the development season is open for business.**

The Ubuntu developers have already started working on the next Ubuntu version, and the first development images have been produced. Don't expect too much from the new Ubuntu build, at least not yet. It will be a couple of months until some major changes are visible.

If you boot it right now it still says Ubuntu 14.04, so you can see that this is only a placeholder for the features that will get implemented along the way.

“The first autosync with Debian is running right now, so don't get overexcited and sync something by hand that the automated machinery will get to in the next hour. The buildds will be very, very angry with us for a couple of days due to the above autosync. Have some patience. Upload your merges, and don't babysit the queues. You'll thank me for it. You might even want to go out for a walk, get some fresh air, feed a duck, that sort of thing,” said Adam Conrad on the official mailing list.

The developer explained that ruby-defaults has been updated to version 2.1, boost-defaults has been updated to version .55, a new binutils snapshot has been added, and all the other packages have received some “tiny unicorns” (it's probably a given that many of the Ubuntu developer's statements will be littered with various puns).

Ubuntu 14.10 (Utopic Unicorn) is also the perfect version for the developers who want to push some of the updates that didn't make it into Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (Trusty Tahr) or that got rejected for whatever reason. This is the perfect playground for new packages, and users might see some very interesting things in the final released of Ubuntu 14.10.

“I know post-LTS releases are always an exciting barrage of tossing in all the things you didn't think you could land in an LTS without the release team glaring at you, and I'm sure this one will be no exception. So, have fun, happy uploading, and do try to fix two bugs for every one you upload,” also said Adam Conrad.

Users don't have anything to see for now and the image is mostly used for development purposes. You can download it from the official Ubuntu [servers][1].

Remember that this is a development version and it should NOT be installed on production machines. It is intended for testing purposes only.
