Vivaldi 4.0 Looks Like an All-in-One Browser for Linux
======

Vivaldi 4.0 is the latest version that introduces new functionalities for multitaskers and users who rely on web browsers for everything.

It is worth noting that only the UI layer of Vivaldi is closed-source, more than 93% of its source code is open-source. Even though it is not completely FOSS, many users use it because of its anti-tracking policy, appealing interface, and active Linux support.

In case you did not know, recently [Vivaldi made significant performance improvements][1] taking Linux (Ubuntu) into account for testing. So, it looks like they keep Linux users in mind, which is a good thing.

If you thought [Firefox 89][2] release was exciting, Vivaldi is particularly interesting for its new additions.

### Vivaldi 4.0: What’s New?

The latest major release focuses to prove itself as a better alternative to popular web browsers like Google Chrome, and Microsoft Edge.

#### Vivaldi Translate

![][3]

Powered by [Lingvanex][4], Vivaldi Translate delivers a concise translation for your text, removing the need to install a plugin or using a separate translator tool and providing a secure translation too.

Have you ever had to access a website in a language you do not understand? If yes, then you know how painful it is to copy-paste the text into a translator to understand what the page is saying.

But now that you have an integrated tool with Vivaldi that facilitates your browsing experience without compromising your privacy. You can access the translation feature using the icon in the address bar whenever you load a website with a different language.

#### Vivaldi Mail (Beta)

![][5]

Using a browser is a good way of exchanging information, including emails. When you have multiple emails for different purposes, it can get quickly overwhelming managing them.

Mail makes it easier by assembling your diverse emails into a single place in the web browser. Due to its support for IMAP and POP3, you can integrate most email providers.

So, you do not have to install a 3rd party webmail client to keep things convenient to access.

#### Vivaldi Feed Reader (Beta)

![][6]

RSS is the go-to online reading for many users.

While we have [RSS readers for Linux][7] already. You can access Vivaldi Feed Reader right from Mail; thus, allowing you to filter feeds and apply certain properties on them.

You can add articles, YouTube videos, podcasts, and more to the feed. When you load up a site for anything, a feed icon comes up in the right-side of the address bar. All you have to do is click on it to add things to your feed, it is that easy.

#### Vivaldi Calendar (Beta)

Vivaldi Calendar does all that you expect from a full-fledged calendar app without the trade-off of your privacy. And this is an extremely useful addition to Vivaldi.

Accessing what you plan without launching a separate service or app and having the ability to quickly access it in your browser should save a lot of time.

#### Other Changes

While Vivaldi offers a lot of features, it also makes it easy to choose the experience you want right after you launch the browser

There are three layouts you can select:

![][3]

  * **Essentials**: Only Ad blocker and translations available.
  * **Classic**: Everything in essentials, plus side panels and status bar.
  * **Fully Loaded:** All the features offered ready for access in your layout including the Calendar, Mail, and Feed Reader.



For more information on how it all works and details of the latest release, you may want to go through the [announcement post][8].

### Summing Up

Vivaldi is a cross-platform web browser that does not neglect Linux users. With the latest Vivaldi 4.0 release, the browser offers an exciting experience with an arsenal of features that major web browsers do not offer.

You can download the latest update from the official website (DEB/RPM files available). You can also choose to manually add the repositories for your distribution using the [official instructions][9].
