Meta Aims to Build an Open-Source ChatGPT Contender
======
Meta has decided to work on an open-source alternative to OpenAI's
ChatGPT. This should be interesting.
The artificial intelligence race has been reignited again!

This time around, Meta (Facebook/Instagram's parent company) gets the attention.

In the past, we have seen the likes of Mozilla [betting big][1] on developing an open-source AI ecosystem and the likes of [Dolly][2] and [HuggingChat][3] acting as open-source alternatives to ChatGPT.

However, with Meta's new undertaking, we might have something even more significant. Allow me to take you through it.

**What's Happening:** According to a recent report by _[The Wall Street Journal][4]_ , [Meta][5] intends to take the fight to OpenAI's ChatGPT by building **a new open-source AI system,** **expected to be as capable as GPT-4**.

Interestingly, Meta is no stranger to developing an AI system; **** they already have the [**Llama**][6] open-source large language model co-developed with Microsoft, which recently received a new [major release][7].

But this upcoming model is dubbed several times more powerful than that! 🤯

Moreover, an open-source approach to a potential ChatGPT replacement sounds exciting!

Other companies are expected to benefit from the system, allowing them to build services to produce sophisticated text, analysis, and other types of output.

**When to Expect:** The work has already begun, with Meta **readying up the data centers** necessary to pull off this job.

They have opted for [NVIDIA H100][9] data-center GPUs, signaling a move away from using Microsoft's [Azure][10], and focusing on training this new model on their infrastructure.

It is speculated that **Meta will begin training the new model in early 2024** , with Mark Zuckerberg leading the dedicated team to make it all happen.

Even though Meta has been late to the generative AI game, **this new open-source AI system should put them right back into the mix** , especially when Google is also launching a powerful competitor to GPT-4 called ' _Gemini_ '.

_💬 What are your thoughts on Meta's initiative for an open-source ChatGPT competitor?_
