#### Upgrade from Zorin 15.x

There is no upgrade path available at the moment from Zorin OS 15. However, as per the team, an upgrade path will be available soon when Zorin 15 users can easily upgrade to the latest version.

### Closing Notes

One of the best feature of Zorin is its unique way of handling App ecosystem. It is probably the only Linux desktop distribution which provides out-of-the-box experience to search and install apps from Flathub, Snap Store, AppImage, Ubuntu/Own repo via its Software Store. You do not require to manually configure your system for Snap or Flatpak. That said, It’s still a modified GNOME with additional items. Some may not prefer Zorin and may feel bloated with all these features pre-loaded. In that sense, it is one of the ideal distro for new Linux desktop users who need a ready-made Windows/macOS like feel with all the Linux features.
