Forza Horizon 5 on Linux? There’s a Good Chance That You Can Play it Already
======

Forza Horizon 5 is a new racing video game developed by Playground Games and published by Xbox Game Studios.

Before its official launch, it already had **~1 million players** via the premium edition, which enabled early access to the game.

While the game is breathtaking with its visuals and optimization for older hardware, it is yet another Windows-only game.

Fortunately, it is also available on Steam. So, there is a possibility of trying it out using the proton compatibility layer on Linux.

### Forza Horizon 5 on Linux Seems Like a Reality

Initially, the state of Forza Horizon 4 running on Linux was poor. It was unplayable as per the reports on ProtonDB.

With improvements to Proton (or [SteamPlay for Linux][1]), now there’s a silver rating to it. It’s still not satisfactory, but better than nothing.

And, the story doesn’t get better with Forza Horizon 5, with an unplayable rating on [ProtonDB][2].

However, I noticed a few individuals have succeeded in their attempts to run Forza Horizon 5.

**Jeremy Soller** (a System76 engineer) shared a tweet where he can be seen playing Forza Horizon 5 on Pop!_OS 21.10 Beta:

And, he wasn’t alone; Tom (aka GloriousEggroll), Wine-staging maintainer and Proton-GE developer, also shared a tweet playing Forza Horizon 5 on Linux:

> Not too bad for linux for a game that released 5 days ago o/ &lt;insert it's working gif&gt; [pic.twitter.com/aoBKEKQKsq][5]

Furthermore, GloriousEggroll mentions in the tweet thread:

> Paul (one of the wine devs) pushed fixes to proton experimental, in addition to a fix that was needed in vkd3d. I ported them over to proton-ge already (along with the battleye patches -and- CEG drm patches).

So, it looks like you can play Forza Horizon 5 using Proton’s latest experimental bleeding-edge version.

Of course, this is not an ideal solution for everyone. But, it is good to know that the latest Proton Experimental bleeding-edge makes it possible to play Forza Horizon 5 (on Steam).

### Should You Get Forza Horizon 5 on Steam for Linux?

If you are aiming to play it on Linux exclusively, you may want to wait it out.

As per a [GitHub issue thread][7] on Proton, it appears that there are some issues with the game, even if you use the bleeding-edge version of Proton Experimental.

But, if you want to help generate a bug report and test it out, feel free to try it out!

Of course, if you have dual-boot configured with Windows or have another Windows-powered system, you can purchase the game if you like.

Hopefully, with the next Proton Experimental or Stable release, we may get the necessary support for Forza Horizon 5!

_What do you think about Forza Horizon 5 on Linux? Have you tested it for yourself?_
