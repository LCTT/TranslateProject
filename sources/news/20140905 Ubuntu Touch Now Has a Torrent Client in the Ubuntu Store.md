**The Ubuntu Touch platform is already the host of many interesting applications, and it looks like the developers have started to implement software that goes beyond what you might expect, like a torrent client for example.**

The app store for Ubuntu Touch has been growing steadily over the past few months and interesting applications are added all the time. Most of them are covering some of the basic needs of the operating system, but there are quite a few that go well beyond regular users’ needs.

A torrent client is not something that you will find on most phones. Android and Windows Phone already have this kind of apps and it looks like Ubuntu is now one of those platforms. Ubuntu developer [Alan Pope][1] posted a screenshot with a new application that's being developed for the Ubuntu platforms called DowNow.

This is a relatively new application and it's still under development. You can find the click package for DowNow 0.3 in Launchpad, if you want to take a closer look, or you can download from Ubuntu Software Center.

For now, the only supported devices are Nexus 4 and Nexus 7, if you want to test Ubuntu for phones, but that might change in the coming months.
