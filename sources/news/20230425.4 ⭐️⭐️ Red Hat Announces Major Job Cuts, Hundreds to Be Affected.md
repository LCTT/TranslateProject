Red Hat Announces Major Job Cuts, Hundreds to Be Affected
======

Even Red Hat cannot escape from the recession wave.

![red hat layoff][1]

The tech space has been seeing a spree of layoffs across many organizations; take, for example, the massive layoffs over at [Twitter][2] and [Lyft][3].

The post-pandemic blues have started in a big way for the information technology industry, and [Red Hat][4] is among the latest to have been affected by that.

With a recent announcement, they have announced significant job cuts across the organization.

**What's Happening:** A subsidiary of IBM, Red Hat, is all set to **cut just under 4% of its workforce** over the coming months 😱

This revelation was made by Matt Hicks, CEO of Red Hat, in an **email sent out early on Monday** outlining the **layoffs** and **major changes** coming to the organization.

Red Hat is known for its open-source offerings, such as the ever-growing **Red Hat Enterprise Linux** (RHEL), open hybrid cloud products, and **Ansible automation platform**.

They have been growing steadily over the years, even after their acquisition by IBM, but it is worrying to see such layoffs impacting a well-performing company.

On this, Matt mentioned:

> Like every company, Red Hat’s resources are finite, and our investments, including our investments in talent, must be aligned with our strategy.

You can go through the [announcement blog][5] to dive deeper into their decision.

**So, what does this entail?**

Well, **hundreds of jobs are set to be affected** across the organization. Currently, Red Hat employs around **2,200 employees at their headquarters** in the US and **over 19,000 employees spread around the world**.

Layoffs **won't impact customer-facing roles** such as sales and the development side of things. Instead, the focus of the layoffs will be on **general/administrative and similar roles** across all functions of the organization.

**The painful reality:** The fallout of the **COVID-19 pandemic** is now starting to show its signs in the information technology industry, with layoffs being a common sight in recent months.

This has been a slightly delayed reaction compared to other industries that have already suffered a lot due to the pandemic.

But it has finally hit the tech industry, and now everyone must prepare for a very cold hiring season.
