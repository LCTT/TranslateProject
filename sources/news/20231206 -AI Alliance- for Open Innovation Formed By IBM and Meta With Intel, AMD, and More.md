'AI Alliance' for Open Innovation Formed By IBM and Meta With Intel, AMD, and More
======
An alliance like this should prevent a single company dominating the AI
advancements. What do you think?
2023 is a very happening year for Artificial Intelligence, we are still seeing new developments as this year comes to an end. The latest among which is an **AI-focused coalition formed by IBM, Meta, and over 50 other** collaborators.

They even have a neat name, it is aptly called “[The AI Alliance][1]” 😊

So, let's dive in and see what they plan to achieve.

![][2]

**What's happening:** Launched by [IBM][3] and [Meta][4], The **AI Alliance is a group of organizations from different verticals** that includes **start-ups** , **well-established companies** , **governments** , **researchers** , and even **prestigious educational institutions** with one key focus.

> To support open innovation and open science in AI.

All the members of this AI-focused alliance are **set to collaborate with each other by being part of an open community** that allows both developers and researchers to further “ _responsible innovation_ ” in AI.

**What to Expect:** According to the objectives laid out by The AI Alliance for starting projects. They intend to build **a framework that would consist of benchmarks, evaluation standards, tools, and other resources** to “ _enable the responsible development and use of AI systems at a global scale_ ”.

That would **** also ****** include the **creation of a catalog of audited safety, security, and trust tools** to further enhance the security of the projects under this alliance.

Moreover, they also plan to take [open foundation models][5] further by **pushing for a diverse set of models** that would concentrate on being _multilingual_ , _multi-modal_ , and _science-focused_.

You might be wondering; **who are the other members in the alliance?**

Well, as I mentioned earlier, there are over 50 organizations in the **AI Alliance**. Some of the **most notable ones** include:

  * **AMD**
  * **Intel**
  * **Oracle**
  * **CERN**
  * **Hugging Face**
  * **Yale University**
  * **Indian Institute of Technology Bombay**



Even [The Linux Foundation][6] has forayed into this alliance. [Jim Zemlin][7], Executive Director of The Linux Foundation, mentioned:

> _The AI Alliance is another milestone in the process of providing for openly shareable software, data, and other assets essential to the development of transparent, advanced and trustworthy AI._

> _Open collaborative processes and open governance are essential to these efforts and working with our _[PyTorch Foundation][8]_ , _[LF AI and Data Foundation][9]_ , _[Cloud Native Computing Foundation][10]_ , we look forward to participating in and assisting the Alliance by providing a neutral home for essential elements of the AI ecosystem._

That does sound good, only time will tell what kind of results will come out of the collaboration between members of the AI Alliance.

For more details on the objectives of this alliance, or to learn about the founding members, you can go through the [official blog][11].

### Wrapping Up

In recent times, we have been seeing **a considerable increase in the implementation of AI-powered solutions** , and even **lawsuits concerning the use of copyrighted data** by such tools.

I also noticed that **a few notable names were missing** from this alliance; the likes of **Google** , **OpenAI** , and **Microsoft** are not a part of this. Of course, they have separate agendas to their AI-focused solutions, which we cannot expect it to be open.

However, an alliance made with partnerships like sounds like the much-needed push for open-source AI to ensure that the AI advancements are not dominated by just a single or couple of companies.

_💬 What do you think? Will the AI Alliance work?_
