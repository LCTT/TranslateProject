IEEE Standards Association Launches an Open Source Collaboration Platform
======

_**Brief: IEEE Standards Association has announced a GitLab-based open source collaboration platform. Read how is it different and what advantages it has.**_

[IEEE][1] is the world’s largest technical professional organization dedicated to advancing technology. The IEEE Standards Association (IEEE SA) is an organization within IEEE that develops global standards in a broad range of industries.

The IEEE Standards Association (SA) has come up with an open-source collaboration platform i.e [IEEE SA Open][2].

It is technically a self-hosted GitLab instance combined with [Mattermost][3] (a [slack alternative][4]) and [GitLab Pages][5]. To describe it further, the [official blog post][6] mentioned:

> The platform enables independent software developers, startups, industry, academic institutions, and others to create, test, manage, and deploy innovative projects in a collaborative, safe, and responsible environment.

### How is it different or useful?

The main key attraction for this platform would be IEEE’s members’ network, technical expertise, and resources.

IEEE President, [Robert Fish][7], also mentions in brief (during an interview with Radio Kan) how it’s different and why IEEE wanted to go with it:

> Today, much of the world’s infrastructure is run by software, and that software needs to comply with standards in communications networking, electrical grids, agriculture, and the like.

It makes sense – if we want to improve standardizing technologies, it highly depends on the software. So, this definitely sounds like something to standardize innovative open-source projects to gear them up for potential capital opportunities as well.

IEEE also clarified that:

> As software becomes increasingly prevalent in the world today, ethical alignment, reliability, transparency, and democratic governance become must-haves. IEEE is uniquely positioned to endow open-source projects with these attributes.

While this sounds good, what exactly the open-source platform by the IEEE offer? Let’s take a look at that:

### IEEE SA Open: Quick overview

![][8]

To start with, it is open to all and completely free to use. You just need to create an [IEEE account][9] and then [sign in to the open-source platform][10] to get started.

Along with the benefits associated with IEEE’s extensive network of Members, you can also expect guidance support from their open-source community managers or community members.

![Ieee Gitlab][11]

The platform presents use cases for both standard and non-standard projects, so you can give it a try.

For its choice to go with GitLab combined with Mattermost and Pages, you get a couple of useful features, they are:

  * Project planning and management features
  * Source code management
  * Testing, code quality, and continuous integration features
  * Docker container registry and Kubernetes integration
  * Application release and delivery features
  * Integrated Mattermost chat forum w/slash commands; (Android and iPhone apps are fully supported)
  * Capable of bridging the gap between Standards development and open source communities to allow for the advancement of nimble and creative technical solutions at a faster pace
  * A safe open space with an enforced code of conduct



### Wrapping Up

It’s obviously a good thing to have more platforms to potentially amplify the exposure of open-source projects – hence, IEEE’s initiative sounds promising to start with.

What do you think about it? Let me know your thoughts!
