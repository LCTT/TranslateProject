[Ubuntu.com][1], the website of [Canonical][2]'s Linux-based operating system for PCs, servers, the cloud and (maybe soon) mobile devices, has received a series of subtle but significant upgrades recently, and more are on the way. Here's a look at the latest site updates and additions for the cloud, Canonical's partner network and more.

The Ubuntu design team outlined the enhancements to ubuntu.com in a recent [blog post][3]. The full list of changes is available there, but the most significant tweaks and updates include:

- The creation of a Chinese site for Ubuntu, [ubuntu-china.cn][4], which could help create new inroads for Canonical in the Asian market, where Ubuntu has traditionally taken a backseat to locally grown Linux distributions. The move may also help to strengthen Canonical's relationship with China-based [Meizu][5], one of the two hardware manufacturers with which it has [partnered][6] to deliver mobile phones running Ubuntu by the end of this year.
- A new version of [Ubuntu Insights][7], a Web portal where Canonical publishes news about the Ubuntu world.

Those are only the changes that the design team has already completed. Currently in the works for future implementation are:

- Updates to the Web interface for Canonical's [Juju][8] cloud orchestration service.
- The debut of a series of changes throughout the Ubuntu website that will make it more "[responsive][9]," which means enhancing readability, accessibility and the general visitor experience across different types of devices.
- A new [Ubuntu Partners][10] website.
- Further development of the Chinese Ubuntu website, including the addition of cloud and server sections.

All of these updates are good news for Canonical's customers and partners. But what makes the changes truly remarkable is how far Ubuntu's Web presence has evolved since the operating system's debut nearly 10 years ago, when ubuntu.com looked like [this][11], and the landing page primarily featured images of people dressed in workout clothes.
