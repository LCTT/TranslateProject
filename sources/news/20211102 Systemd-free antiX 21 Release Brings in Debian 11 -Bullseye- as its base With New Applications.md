Systemd-free antiX 21 Release Brings in Debian 11 “Bullseye” as its base With New Applications
======

AntiX, a popular Debian-based distro for users not wanting Systemd, has just announced its version 21 release. This release brings a couple of improvements, most notably using Debian 11 as a base, alongside updated apps and kernels.

Before we start, it should be noted that AntiX uses SysVinit, instead of the much more popular Systemd. This means that it may not be ideal for beginners. With that out of the way, let’s look at some of the exciting changes in AntiX 21!

### Updated Debian Base

Back in August, [Debian 11 (codenamed][1] “Bullseye”) was [released with a large variety of new features][1]. Now, many of those features have made their way to AntiX, thanks to its upgrading to a Debian 11 base.

Some of the benefits include:

  * Updated Desktop Environments
  * Newer Linux kernel 5.10 LTS (We’ll have a look at this later)
  * An extra 5 years of official support from the Debian team
  * Updated packages in the repositories



I think almost all users will agree that this change is a great one, especially as it allows users to access much newer versions of their favorite applications.

### Linux Kernel 5.10 LTS

Alongside the legacy 4.9 Linux Kernel, AntiX uses the [recent Linux Kernel 5.10 LTS][2]. This means significantly improved hardware support, as well as some performance improvements. Plus, with the dual-kernel design of AntiX, users of older systems shouldn’t find any new and unexpected bugs.

### Updated Apps

One trend that I have noticed recently is that software seems to be improving at an increasing pace. Therefore, it is always great to see updated apps available, especially for a relatively small distribution such as antiX. Some of the app updates with this release include:

  * Firefox 78 LTS
  * LibreOffice 7.0.4
  * Claws Mail 3.17.8



In addition to these, you will notice a new login manager along with some app replacements:

  * zzzFM replaces SpaceFM
  * slimski replaces Slim
  * ytfzf replaces mps-youtube



More apps have also been updated thanks to the previously mentioned Debian 11 base.

### Wrapping Up

With all these improvements, antiX 21 is looking to be an excellent upgrade for existing and potential users.

If you want to try antiX now, feel free to download it from the button below. For a complete list of changes, I’d recommend looking at the [release notes][3].
