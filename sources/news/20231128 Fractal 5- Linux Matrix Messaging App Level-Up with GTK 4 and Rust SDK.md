Fractal 5: Linux Matrix Messaging App Level-Up with GTK 4 and Rust SDK
======
Matrix messaging app for GNOME gets an upgrade with GTK4, Rust SDK, and
more.
[Matrix][1], a popular network for secure, decentralized communication, is getting more relevant day-by-day. The world around us is changing at a pace previously unheard of, and the need for a secure communication tool is just one of its by-products, among other things.

One such tool that helps in leveraging Matrix, is Fractal. It is one of the [best Matrix clients for decentralized messaging][2].

With a recent announcement, **Fractal 5** is here with a major overhaul 🎉

So, let's take a brief look at it.

## 🆕 Fractal 5: What's New?

![][3]

Being **a complete rewrite** compared to the previous release, Fractal 5 now makes use of [GTK 4][4], [libadwaita][5], and the [Matrix Rust SDK][6] for providing a modern looking interface that just feels at home.

Fractal now **scales properly on all kinds of screens** , be it small or large; users of the previous releases should find it familiar without much of a learning curve.

Moreover, it is now possible to **reply to specific messages** , **react to messages** with emoji, and even **edit/remove messages** while chatting on Fractal.

![][7]

You can also **send your current location** to any of your chats, just ensure that your system supports 'Location Services', and is enabled.

Viewing images and playing audio or video is now more intuitive, you can directly view/play those from the chat window itself.

![][9]

And lastly, Fractal now has **support for logging into multiple accounts** , with additional support for [Single-Sign On][10] (SSO). This will make it effortless to handle multiple accounts on the same client instance.

![][11]

**For its future releases** , the developers have planned to add some neat features such as room settings, better moderation tools, and notification settings. They also want to improve the accessibility side of things.

You may go through the [release notes][12] to learn all the technical details.

I am glad to see that Fractal is being actively developed, and if you ask me, this release brings it more on par with the under development [ElementX][13], a successor to the Element messaging app.

**Suggested Read** 📖

![][14]

I am excited about a time when Matrix is not just a niche thing used by a few, but the norm suggested by many.
