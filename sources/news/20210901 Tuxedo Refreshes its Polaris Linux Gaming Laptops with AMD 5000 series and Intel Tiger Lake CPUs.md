Tuxedo Refreshes its Polaris Linux Gaming Laptops with AMD 5000 series and Intel Tiger Lake CPUs
======

The German Linux PC manufacturer has recently announced the third revision of its Tuxedo Polaris 15 and 17 gaming laptops.

The laptops primarily come in two different display sizes – 15.6 and 17.3 inches – hence the names. Featuring mid to high range specifications, these PCs come in various configurations, including an option to install Windows 10 other than the flagship Tuxedo OS 20.04 that’s based on Ubuntu 20.04.

Let’s take a quick look at what these laptops have to offer.

### What’s on the inside?

The most notable specification is the use of the latest AMD Ryzen 7 5800H and Intel Core i7-11800H processors. This is a big upgrade from the previous model’s Ryzen 7 4800H and Core i7-10870H. While both offer 8 cores and 16 threads, Intel is the way to go if you want to game, otherwise AMD will get your job done. This is based on the tests uploaded on their websites.

Another feature gamers will certainly love is the new RTX 3060 that was also used in the previous revision. Combined with 6GB GDDR6 VRAM and TGP upto 115W, 1080p gaming will certainly be enjoyable.

The cooling system design has been improved and the laptop is equipped with a 62 Wh Lithium battery, the laptops are believed to last upto 6 hours under normal working conditions.

As for the memory is concerned, a 3200 MHz DDR4 RAM up to 64 GB is available. There is ample space for (fast) storage due to the presence of two SSD slots in M.2 form-factor totaling up to 2 TB.

### Display

Both IPS display sizes come with a standard ratio of 16:9 upto 165Hz. Moreover, you can choose between a 2K Full-HD and 3K WQHD displays with a brightness of 300 nits and 350 nits receptively.
