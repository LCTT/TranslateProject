Fedora 36 Release Date and New Features
======

Fedora 36 is one of the [most anticipated releases of this year][1].

While we look forward to every major release, last year, [Fedora 35][2] has set up some exciting expectations with GNOME 41 and a new KDE flavor (Kinoite).

Fret not; if you cannot wait for Fedora 36, I shall highlight the essential details about the release.

### Fedora 36 Release Date

As per the official schedule, the early release date for Fedora 36 beta is **March 15, 2022**. And, the delayed date (in case) for Fedora 36 beta is **March 22, 2022**.

Once the public beta testing is complete, the final release can be expected on **April 19, 2022**. In case of a delay, the release date will be pushed to **April 26, 2022**.

You should also note that Fedora Linux 34 will reach its end of life on May 17**, 2022.**

You can try to get your hands on Fedora 36 now with a nightly build (linked at the bottom of this article), but with a few weeks to go for the beta release, you should wait it out.

### Fedora 36 Features

![][4]

As usual, Fedora 36 features the latest GNOME and other additions and improvements.

The key highlights include:

### 1\. GNOME 42

[GNOME 42][5] is an exciting upgrade with various visual and functional changes.

It also includes performance and visual tweaks, among other improvements. If you missed [GNOME 41 feature additions][6], you should also check that.

Of course, you should expect to find all the changes with Fedora 36. Here, I shall highlight those details using Fedora 36 (if you didn’t catch up with GNOME 42).

### 2\. System-wide Dark Mode

![][7]

Fedora 36 enjoys the system-wide dark mode introduced with GNOME 42.

While we had dark mode implementations on other Linux distributions, GNOME 42 helped Fedora 36 become an attractive option for desktop users.

The dark mode blends in perfectly and gives a clean GNOME experience.

### 3\. New Wallpapers

Without a new wallpaper, every other improvement sounds dull.

So, the Fedora Design Team brings along a beautifully crafted wallpaper in Fedora 36, illustrating the painting of a scenery, that looks interesting.

The default wallpaper has a variant for day/night. As you notice the wallpaper for day time above, here’s the artwork for the night:

Both look fantastic and soothing to the eyes.

### 4\. Linux Kernel 5.17

Fedora 36 is known to offer the latest Linux Kernel releases. As of now, it is currently running the release candidate versions of the upcoming Linux Kernel 5.17.

With the final Fedora 36 release, you should expect the stable version of Linux Kernel 5.17.

### 5\. Dark/Light Wallpapers

Along with the new default wallpapers for Fedora 36, it also features a dark/light mode wallpaper collection introduced with GNOME 42.

![][9]

As of now, testing the Fedora 36 Workstation (pre-release version), I can only find one of the wallpapers and not the whole collection that you get with GNOME 42.

So, you can probably expect more additions with Fedora 36 beta release.

You can choose to select the wallpapers with their available dark/light variants from the appearance.

### 6\. Screenshot User Interface and Native Screen Recording

The new screenshot user interface introduced with GNOME 42 is a fantastic addition. Also, with just a toggle, you can start recording your screen!

![][10]

And, you could see that in action with Fedora 36, working perfectly fine.

### 7\. Desktop Environment Updates

For obvious reasons, you should expect the latest desktop environments with Fedora 36.

The bare minimum should be GNOME 42, [KDE Plasma 5.24][11], and Xfce 4.16.

In addition to that, LXQt has been updated to 1.0.0.

### 8\. Important Technical Changes

Along with the visual changes and the Linux Kernel upgrade, there are various technical improvements with Fedora 36.

Some of them worth mentioning include:

  * Updated the system openJDK package from Java 11 to Java 17.
  * Introducing the upcoming Golang 1.18 version.
  * Switching to Noto fonts as the default for various languages to ensure consistency in text rendering.
  * The behaviour to exclude the recommended packages (considering you do not have them installed) when automatically upgrading in future.
  * GNU Toolchain update to gcc 12 and glibc 2.35.
  * Fix upgradability issues in some cases.
  * Default Wayland session with NVIDIA proprietary driver.
  * Updated PHP stack to latest 8.1.x.
  * The RPM database will be relocated to /usr directory, currently it was in /var.



For more technical details, you can refer to the [official changeset][12]. If you want to download the pre-release version, you can grab the ISO from the button below.

### Wrapping Up

Fedora 36 is going to be an exciting release.

When it releases, I’m looking forward to trying the Wayland session with NVIDIA’s proprietary driver on Fedora 36 Workstation.
