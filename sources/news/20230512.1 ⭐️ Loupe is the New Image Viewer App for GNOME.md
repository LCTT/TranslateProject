Loupe is the New Image Viewer App for GNOME
======

GNOME's new image viewer? Looks nice!

![loupe image viewer][1]

The folks over at GNOME have been busy!

Recently, you might have heard that they are [considering][2] bringing back the terminal app to replace the new console, then there's the [new camera app][3] set to replace Cheese in the near future.

You might have missed something else we did not cover among those core GNOME app changes.

**A new image viewer app for GNOME called 'Loupe'**. It has been accepted into GNOME's [Incubator Group][4].

Allow me to take you through this.

> 💡 The 'Incubator' group contains projects set to be part of GNOME Core and GNOME Development tools, signifying that **this might someday make it into a GNOME release**.

### 🆕 Loupe: What is it?

So, as I was saying, this is a new image viewer app for GNOME, **written in the memory-safe Rust programming language,** and offers some cool features.

Take, for instance, the on-screen buttons to switch through various photos, zoom in/out, go into full-screen mode, and more.

Then there's the metadata viewer that has been integrated nicely into the interface, showing data such as the **location, size, resolution, date of creation,** etc.

That's not all; Loupe also supports keyboard and trackpad shortcuts! See for yourself.

These keyboard/trackpad shortcuts and gestures should be convenient for laptop users.

This is a nice touch 🤗

Also, how can I forget about the the **copy to clipboard**, **move to trash** and **print image** options that can be accessed from the ribbon-menu and the header, respectively?

Here's that in action:

It's neat, isn't it?

I must say, Loupe has a nifty set of features I see myself using daily while going through my photos.

It aims to replace the existing [Eye of GNOME][8] (eog) Image Viewer, maybe with the release of GNOME 45, barring any issues, of course.

### 📥 Get Loupe

You can grab Loupe from the [Flathub store][9], and also explore its source code on [GitLab][10].

_💬 What do you think? Will Loupe be a good choice as the default image viewer on GNOME for you?_
