KDE’s Latest Move Will Help Raspberry Pi and PinePhone Pro Users Immensely
======

KDE recently shared its monthly updates on the latest app developments and progress, as usual.

While the [Falkon 3.2 release][1] was a significant upgrade, there were several other updates/bug fixes to other KDE applications.

However, there was one interesting thing about it.

KDE is starting to make applications available for the ARM Platforms.

But, what does it mean exactly? Let’s take a look!

### KDE Apps for ARM: An Exciting Development!

You can find KDE apps on various repositories, Flatpak, and the Snap store.

And, KDE chose the Snap store to publish its first Snap for ARM64.

In other words, KDE applications are making their way as a Snap to the ARM platform.

Of course, it makes sense for an application to support a variety of platforms and various distributions, all from a single store.

The first Snap available for ARM64 is [kblocks][2].

Considering that it is a classic falling blocks game, and a fun idea, it may not be a big deal for the ARM platform.

However, if you have a Raspberry Pi or a PinePhone Pro, it should be a good indication to expect more KDE apps optimized for the ARM platform available through the Snap store.

### The Future with ARM Chips

Considering the early developments for the ARM platform, I’d say it is good progress when compared to the number of devices available.

As of now, the Raspberry Pi users and the PinePhone pro users can immediately benefit from new KDE applications.

As we start to see more ARM-powered devices or laptops, you should expect almost everyone to start prepping for ARM.

Hopefully, the Linux platform and its applications will be ready for the ARM platform when the time comes.

We should avoid a situation like Apple’s M1 series, where the performance makes a big difference without having a proper app ecosystem available.

_What do you think about KDE apps available as a Snap for ARM64? Assuming you have a Raspberry Pi or PinePhone Pro, what do you expect for its future?_

Let me know your thoughts in the comments below.
