Huawei Claims They Have Something Better Than The Linux Kernel
======
Huawei is known for its interesting innovations in smartphone tech. So,
it is an intriguing claim.
Many of us know and love what the [Linux kernel][1] has to offer, but we still have really great alternatives around in the form of the many [BSD][2]-based derivatives out there.

But, as it stands, **a new competitor to the Linux kernel has come up** from the house of [Huawei][3]. Let's see what that is all about.

The quotes mentioned in this article have been translated from Chinese (Simplified).

**What's Happening:** According to a [recent report][5], Huawei has unveiled a new kernel called “ **Harmony kernel** ” for its next generation of HarmonyOS that **claims to be three times more efficient than the Linux kernel**.

Announced during an event where Yu Chengdong, the **CEO** of Huawei's **Consumer Business Group** , unveiled what [HarmonyOS][7] NEXT would offer. He said that their company had made “ _a true OS this time which installs full-stack self-developed technologies and doesn't rely upon the U.S. traditional Linux cores_ ”.

As for the Harmony kernel, Yu added that it uses a “ **heterogeneous native-like** ” mechanism to offer a smooth experience, and that the Harmony kernel implementation for HarmonyOS NEXT is **three times more memory efficient than Linux**.

They also claim that they have used “ **effective internal components** ” to suit all kinds of devices, ranging from **smartphones** , **tablets** , **foldables** , and more.

**On the security side of things** , the Harmony kernel has been said to qualify for three certification standards: [CC EAL 6+][8], [ASIL-D][9], and [IEC 61508][10] making way for a secure experience across many verticals.

**Does it Matter?**

If you ask me, it does for Huawei's home country, China, as in recent times they have been the target of many sanctions from the United States.

Developing a kernel is just one of the things they are pushing for in their bid to be a more self-reliant nation, though the methods they have been using is a matter of great controversy.

Even just a few months back, many GOP lawmakers were [calling for][12] stricter sanctions on Huawei, and according to a [recent report][13], it appears that Huawei is not taking no for an answer.

But, so far, **we only have Huawei's claims about how the Harmony kernel performs** , only time will tell if there is any weight behind this claim.

However, one thing is getting more clear day-by-day, **more and more nations are now pushing towards self-reliance than ever before** , trying to end their dependence on foreign tech.

_💬 What do you think? Will Huawei succeed in their endeavor of making something more efficient than the Linux kernel?_
