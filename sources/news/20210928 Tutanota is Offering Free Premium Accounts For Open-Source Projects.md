Tutanota is Offering Free Premium Accounts For Open-Source Projects
======

Tutanota, a leading end-to-end encrypted mail service, is giving free premium subscriptions to open-source developers.

Online privacy matters. And, people associated with open-source projects prefer using privacy-focused solutions for the same reason.

If you are a part of an open-source project (project lead or an active contributor) older than 30 days, you can get free premium accounts for all your team members.

### Eligibility for Free Premium Account

![][1]

To apply, you have to fulfill the following simple requirements: 

  * You have to be the project’s leader/manager or a core contributor. However, your project should be at least 30 days old.
  * Your project must use a standard open-source license. Most importantly, it must not be commercial.
  * Additionally, your project should not impose charges for support or get payments from contributors.



If you think you meet the criteria, you should email Tutanota (**[press@tutao.de][2]**) from your GitHub email address or your project’s website-linked custom email address.

Make sure to include the project’s name, a short description of your project, and a link to your project website in the email content.

You can verify more details in the [official announcement][3].

### Tutanota Premium Account Benefits

Unlike getting a separate premium subscription, you get a few perks if you are an eligible open-source project:

  * You can register as many users as your project needs within one renewable year of Tutanota Premium, and manage all their encrypted mailboxes and calendars.
  * You can use Tutanota applications on Linux/GNU, the web, Android, Mac, Windows, and iOS.
  * If your project still meets the requirements after a year, you can renew your subscription for free by sending an email again.



In case you did not know about Tutanota’s premium tier, here’s what you will get:

  * 1 GB of storage
  * Multiple custom domains
  * Unlimited search
  * Multiple calendars
  * 5 aliases
  * Inbox rules
  * Support via email
  * Autoresponder
  * Event invites
  * Share calendars

### Wrapping Up

In case you missed it, [1Password also gives free premium subscriptions][5] to eligible open-source projects.

It looks like if you are making genuine efforts in an open-source project, various companies want to reward you with something or the other.

Tutanota is a company that focuses entirely on open-source technologies. So, promoting the use of an open-source encrypted email service is a good thing, after all.
