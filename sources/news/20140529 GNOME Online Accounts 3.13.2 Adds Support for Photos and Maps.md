**The GNOME developers announce that the latest version of GNOME Online Accounts, 3.13.2, is now out and comes with quite a few new features.**

The 3.13.x branch of GNOME is strictly for development and it will eventually evolve into the stable 3.14, but that's a long way ahead. Until then, the developers are free to implement changes and new features.

The previous version in this branch brought some very interesting changes and the devs removed Windows and Twitter support from the software, among other changes.

According to the [changelog][1], support has been added for photos, a deprecated call to GNOME_COMMON_INIT has been removed, the UI has been adjusted so that the Online Accounts can use a header bar in the dialog, the alarm logic has been simplified in order to stop timerfd leaks, and support for maps has been added.

Also, a small memory leak fix has been implemented, the default credentials cache is no longer leaked, and SSL is now used for Flickr for more security.

- [tar.xz (3.12.2 Stable)][2][sources] [1.20 MB]
