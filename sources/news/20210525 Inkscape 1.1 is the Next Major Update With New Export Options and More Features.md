Inkscape 1.1 is the Next Major Update With New Export Options and More Features
======

Last year, [Inkscape 1.0 release][1] hit the surface with tons of new features and improvements after 3 years in development.

Now, after a year, Inkscape 1.1 is here as the next major update with a several new feature additions and improvements.

Let me briefly highlight the significant changes in this release.

### Inkscape 1.1: Key Highlights

To begin with, the new release introduces a new welcome screen along with many new functionalities.

The new welcome dialog helps you quickly set up the initial options before you launch. You also get some pre-configured templates to get a head start with your work.

On the surface there are many more improvements like a rewritten docking system which lets you dock a dialogue on any side of the screen to make things easy.

Another major addition is the **command palette** that provides you instant shortcuts with a press of a key (**Shift** \+ **?**). So, you do not need to remember or use multiple keyboard shortcuts or navigate your way through the menu to achieve several functions.

Now, you can also export files in **JPG, WebP, TIFF, and optimized PNG** format directly from Inkscape.

You will still find the same “**Export PNG Image**” option in the menu but after you click on it under the File menu, you can change the extension of the file to export it any above-mentioned formats.

### More Features &amp; Improvements

In addition to the major changes, you also have numerous important improvements and some new features that should help improve the experience of using Inkscape for digital artists. Some of the improvements include:

  * New outline overlay mode
  * Improved search
  * A copied object now gets added an overlay (on top of it) on the current selected object
  * A new extension manager has been introduced (beta)
