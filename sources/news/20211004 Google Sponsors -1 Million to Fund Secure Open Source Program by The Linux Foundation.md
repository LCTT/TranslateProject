Google Sponsors $1 Million to Fund Secure Open Source Program by The Linux Foundation
======

Google’s love for open-source projects is definitely worth applauding. The California-based tech giant has recently announced its $1 sponsorship for the [Secure Open Source (SOS) pilot program][1] managed by the Linux Foundation.

Not long ago, Google committed $100 million to support third-party foundations fixing security issues in open-source software. So, this sounds like another step in the right direction.

### Improving the Security of Open-Source Projects

The SOS pilot program is a result of an increase in supply chain attacks and security issues in open-source projects that impacts users at large.

The program aims to reward developers working on improving the security of such open-source projects.

According to the Linux Foundation:

> _SOS rewards a very broad range of improvements that proactively harden critical open source projects and supporting infrastructure against application and supply chain attacks_.

It is worth noting that only certain open-source projects will be considered for the program. While it is tough to list critical open-source projects, the program will follow the [National Institute of Standards and Technology’s definition][2] in response to the recent [Executive Order on Cybersecurity][3] to decide if a project can be considered eligible.

Overall, a developer will have to evaluate the significance and the impact of an open-source project before working on it to expect a reward.

Specific types of security improvements have been officially listed to be eligible for the reward. Still, depending on the impact of the project and complexity, an unlisted improvement can qualify.

### Rewards for Minor Improvements to Critical Fixes

No matter the complexity of your improvement, there are chances that a developer will get rewarded if it makes a significant difference.

Reward amounts start from **$505** to **$10,000** or more “for complicated, high-impact, and lasting improvements”.

### Wrapping Up

Google, together with the Linux Foundation, has stated that:

> The SOS program is part of a broader effort to address a growing truth: the world relies on open source software, but widespread support and financial contributions are necessary to keep that software safe and secure. This $1 million investment is just the beginning—we envision the SOS pilot program as the starting point for future efforts that will hopefully bring together other large organizations and turn it into a sustainable, long-term initiative under the OpenSSF.

If you’re interested, you may want to visit the [SOS program’s official site][1] to get all the details. For additional info, you can also refer to [Google’s official announcement][4].
