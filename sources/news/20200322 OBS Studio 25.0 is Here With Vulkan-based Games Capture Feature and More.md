OBS Studio 25.0 is Here With Vulkan-based Games Capture Feature and More
======

_**Brief: Open source screen recording and streaming software OBS Studio 25.0 has just been released and it brings the ability to capture Vulkan-based games with game capture among other new features.**_

If you are into recording your desktop or streaming it, you might have heard of [OBS][2] (Open Broadcaster Software) Studio. It’s one of the [best screen recorder tools on Linux][3] and other operating systems.

But OBS is more than just a simple screen recorder. It also provides all the stuff you need for streaming your recordings.

### New features in OBS Studio 25.0

![OBS 25.0][4]

OBS Studio has released it’s latest version 25.0 with plenty of new features to make your recording and streaming experience better. Let’s take a look at some of the main new features:

  * Capture Vulkan-based games with game capture
  * New capture method to window capture which allows capturing browsers, browser-based windows, and UWP programs
  * Advanced scene collection importing allows you to import from other common streaming programs
  * Media source hotkeys to allow control of playback
  * Ability to drag and drop URLs to create browser sources
  * Support for the [SRT protocol][5]
  * Ability to lock volume values of audio sources in the mixer
  * Support for certain devices that can automatically rotate their camera output such as the Logitech StreamCam
  * System tray icon to show when the recording is paused
  * Help icons when an property has a tooltip associated with it



Apart from there, there are plenty of bug features and minor changes that you may follow in the [release notes][6].

### Install OBS Studio 25.0 on Linux

OBS Studio is a cross-platform software and is also available for Windows and macOS in addition to Linux. You can download it from its official website.

For Linux, you can grab the source code and build it your self. I know that’s not very convenient for everyone. The good news is that you can install the latest OBS version using Snap or Flatpak packages.

On Ubuntu or any other [Linux distribution with Snap support][8], you can use the following command:

```
sudo snap install obs-studio
```

If your distribution supports Fltapak packages, you can get it from Flathub website:

For Ubuntu users, there is also the official PPA for easily installing it. In a terminal, you can enter the following command one by one:

```
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:obsproject/obs-studio
sudo apt update
sudo apt install obs-studio
```

You can [learn about deleting PPA here][10].

Personally, I haven’t used OBS much though I have heard great stuff about it. I don’t live stream but I do record my desktop to create tutorial and information Linux videos on I[t’s FOSS YouTube channel][11] (you should subscribe to it if you haven’t already). For that, I [use Kazam][12] which I find simpler to use.

Do you use OBS Studio? Which features you like the most? Do share your views.
