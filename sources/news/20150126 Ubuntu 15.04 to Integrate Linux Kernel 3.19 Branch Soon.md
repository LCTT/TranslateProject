#The Linux kernel is one of the most important components in a distribution and Ubuntu users are interested to know what will be used in the stable edition for the 15.04 branch, which is scheduled to arrive in a couple of months.

The Ubuntu and the Linux kernel development cycles are not in sync and it's hard to anticipate what version will eventually land in Ubuntu 15.04. For now, Ubuntu 15.04 (Vivid Vervet) is using Linux kernel 3.18, but the developers are already looking to implement the 3.19 branch.

"Our Vivid kernel remains based on the v3.18.2 upstream stable kernel, but we'll be rebasing to v3.18.3 shortly.  We'll also be re-basing our unstable branch to v3.19-rc5 and get that uploaded to our team PPA soon," [said](1) Canonical's Joseph Salisbury.

Linux kernel 3.19 is still under development and it will take a few weeks to see a stable version, but it's enough time to implement it in Ubuntu and test it properly. It won't be possible to get the 3.20 branch, for example, even if it launches before the April 23.

You can [download Ubuntu 15.04](2) right now from Softpedia and give it a spin. It's a daily build and it contains all the improvements made so far to the distribution.
