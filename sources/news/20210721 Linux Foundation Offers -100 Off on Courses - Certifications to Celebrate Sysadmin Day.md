Linux Foundation Offers $100 Off on Courses & Certifications to Celebrate Sysadmin Day
======

If you aspire to become a sysadmin or improve your skills as a system administrator, Linux Foundation has a sweet discount offer to celebrate Sysadmin Day today.

You will get **$100 flat off** of everything included in the catalog. The sale will be valid until **July 30**.

Here, let me briefly mention the certifications and courses available through this deal.

Not just the discount, but you also get a Linux Foundation cap if you purchase anything within the offer period. The instructions for that will be sent to your email and you should receive it after the promotion ends.

### Get Certified and Explore More with Linux Foundation

The catalog includes courses that can help you become a Cybersecurity Analyst, a Data Scientist, a DevOps engineer, System administrator, along with several other career choices.

You will find everything you need to kickstart or grow your IT career.

For instance, you can opt for a system administrator certification, or a Kubernetes certification to meet industry demands for a better future.

The $100 discount applies to every course available in the catalog, in fact, site-wide.

So, any certifications or courses that you wanted from Linux Foundation, should be $100 less than usual.

Considering the entire catalog, you can also choose to explore Blockchain, AI/Machine Learning, IoT, and several more.

If you are browsing through the first time, you should note that you can filter the certifications/courses depending on the level of expertise needed to opt for it. Of course, you would not want to spend on a course if it requires prior experience.

You can click on the button below to access the deal and apply the coupon code **SYSADMIN100** to get the discount.
