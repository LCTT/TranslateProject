Is This The Ultimate Video Streaming App?
======
A source-available app to end all the annoyances of video streaming
applications. What do you think?
Video streaming services mostly include DRMs and restrictions to download offline copies of the media, even if you own them.

Every platform has its set of rules that may or may not be fair to the creators. And, for consumers? Multiple networks to follow, and confusion regarding subscription options available for the platforms.

What if we had a **single application that allowed us to access videos from all those networks?**

**Not just that:** what if we could have the perks of **offline downloads** and more features like the ability to **cast videos to TV** within the same app, without needing to use multiple apps?

And, all of that in the form of **an app whose source code is available to inspect and modify**. Sounds impressive, right?

Well, that's what an organization, [FUTO][1] (with [**Louis Rossmann**][2] being one of its members) has come up with.

Meet " **Grayjay** ", an app where you can **follow content creators across multiple networks** **without DRMs and any unnecessary restrictions**.

### Grayjay: Focusing on Creators

![][3]

Grayjay is a media app that aims to give creators control over the videos they own, along with any monetization opportunities.

The app is in its initial phase, so its primary objective is not yet reflected with the app.

At present, the app is a **source-available** offering where you can watch videos from your favorite networks while getting rid of trackers, ads, and other annoyances of the platforms.

**Louis Rossmann** is at the center of this project, and I believe that makes it worthwhile for us to check it out:

💡

Louis is a popular YouTuber for videos on repairability, anticompetitive practices, and more on the same line. He always speaks his mind, which makes most of us like him.

You can watch the video for details, let me save you some time with a summary:

  * Grayjay aims to be a **better replacement to apps** like [Newpipe][4] and [YouTube ReVanced][5].
  * The app is **source-available** , which allows you to inspect the source code, make your own version of it as per your requirements (but not for commercial usage).
  * The app is **not free** to have a business model where users are treated as customers, not products. However, without any DRM, the app will end up offering you an infinite free trial period.
  * While Louis mentions it as **open-source** for most people to understand, it does not feature the standard license that you would normally expect. They chose to go with a non-standard license to be able to take down malicious redistribution of the app.



You can take a closer look at it on its [GitLab page][6] and its [official website][7].

[Grayjay][7]

It is currently available for Android only. Considering it is still a work-in-progress, you can decide to install the APK to try it out.

_💬 While the app is source-available, Louis mentions that it can be redistributed for personal use-cases. What do you think about Grayjay? Share your thoughts_.
