GIMP is a Free Photoshop Alternative

As the latest entry in the GIMP 2.8.x series — [released back in 2012][2] and notable for introducing the long-sought ‘single window mode’ — version 2.8.12 continues to refine rather than reinvent. As such there are no new user-facing features to be found.

Instead, developers bring a fresh batch of bug fixes to the table aimed at improving the overall stability, security and style of the famous app.

- Brush sizes from plugins are no longer distorted 
- ‘More robust’ loading of .XCF files
- Widget direction now matches interface language (e.g. RTL)
- Security improvements to the script-fu-server 

Documentation, help and translation updates are also included. For a complete change log of everything fixed between 2.8.10 and 2.8.12, see [the GNOME Git notes][2]. 

### Install Latest GIMP in Ubuntu ###

Source for the latest release can be downloaded from the official website or via [an official torrent][3].
