Zorin OS 16.1 is Here, Creators to Donate All Profits from Zorin OS Pro to Aid Ukraine
======

Zorin OS 16 was an exciting release with [plenty of amazing features][1].

Now, its first point release is here with some necessary improvements and updates.

Let me highlight some of the key changes in this release.

### Zorin OS 16.1: What’s New?

Zorin OS 16.1 primarily focuses on updating LibreOffice to help enhance the productivity of users while improving the dark mode.

In addition to LibreOffice, you can find other package updates and other refinements across the board.

With the Zorin OS 16.1 announcement, the creators Artyom &amp; Kyrill shared some of their thoughts on supporting Ukraine as Irish Ukrainians:

> “As Irish Ukrainians ourselves, we stand with our friends and relatives in
>  Ukraine at this difficult time. To the people of Ukraine affected by the war,
>  we’re sending you aid and are pledging to support you.
>
> We hope that the situation de-escalates swiftly and that peace is restored
>  to our ancestral homeland.”

To join the cause, they will be donating all the profits from sales of [Zorin OS Pro][2] for the **next week** to humanitarian aid causes like Red Cross, Doctors Without Borders, and Tabletochki.

Funds raised between now and 17 March (17:00 GMT) will be split equally between
the charities mentioned.
