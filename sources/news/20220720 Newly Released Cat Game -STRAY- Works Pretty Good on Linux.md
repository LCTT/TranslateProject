Newly Released Cat Game ‘STRAY’ Works Pretty Good on Linux
======
Want to play a cat game? Well, you certainly can, and you should not miss the chance!

![stray][1]

*Meow.*

STRAY is currently one of the trending indie games and a unique one where you get to explore a cyberpunk-themed world as a stray cat.

It is a third-person adventure-puzzle game involving a lot of *meows*. Well, maybe because it gives you a “**Meow**” button that you can’t get to stop using throughout the game.

The game includes a pinch of action along with fascinating cyberpunk elements. It isn’t meant to be challenging but an exciting concept where the indie devs managed to present something beautiful.

Officially, it is available for Windows (**Steam**) and PlayStation.

### STRAY on Linux Desktop

![STRAY | Launch Trailer][2]

In case you did not know, STRAY was already *Steam Deck verified* before its launch. So, if you are using a Steam Deck, you should try the game.

And, **what’s better?**

It works just fine on a Linux desktop system as well!

I tested it on **Manjaro Linux** with **Proton Experimental**, running at **1440p** resolution. And, it worked out of the box without any tweaks needed.

The graphics card equipped on my system is an **NVIDIA RTX 3060ti**. So, if you are an NVIDIA graphics user, I do not think it would be a problem.

While I did not notice any major framerate issues with the gameplay so far, there were some micro stutters when I moved the camera in the game. This wasn’t an issue when I tried it on Windows.

Maybe you won’t notice it with a lower refresh rate screen, or it won’t be an issue for you. In any case, with a different distribution/driver, you could have a different experience.

Also, there’s an option to adjust the motion blur and enable V-Sync; you could balance it out with that particular setting.

Can’t wait to try out the game? Head to its [Steam store page][3] and purchase it to get started. The game is available for **$29.99** and also offers regional pricing. So, it could be cheaper for different countries, just like I grabbed it for **$8**.

Have you tried the game already? How do you like it so far? Feel free to share your thoughts in the comments.
