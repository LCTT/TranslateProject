Say Cheese to the Future: Snapshot is GNOME's Next-Gen Camera App
======

A new GNOME camera app starts sailing to replace the classic Cheese utility.

![gnome snapshot][1]

A new app has been accepted into [GNOME's Incubator Group][2], i.e., **Snapshot.**

The first preview release for Snapshot is out, making it an excellent candidate to replace [Cheese][3], the current GNOME webcam app for Linux users.

Let's take a quick look at it.

> 💡 '[Incubator][4]' group contains projects set to be part of GNOME Core and GNOME Development tools, signifying that **this might someday make it into a GNOME release**.

### 🆕 Snapshot: What is it?

As I mentioned earlier, it is a camera app for GNOME. **Written in the memory-safe Rust programming language**, it offers a very minimal set of features.

Designed with mobile devices and traditional desktops/laptops in mind, Snapshot has **a neat user interface** with all the valuable options.

As for the features, it has just about what you would expect from such an app.

It has a '**Countdown**' feature allowing you to set a timer for clicking photos or videos, with a few timing choices.

Then there is the ability to disable the shutter sounds in the app by heading over to the preferences menu.

Snapshot also has a decent gallery view inside the app, letting you view the clicked photos/videos and share or access them using different programs.

**Did you find Snapshot very feature-lacking?**

I don't know about you, but I did.

But, of course, **sometimes, simple is better**. With **GNOME apps, it is usually the case.**

It won't replace GNOME's existing camera app, '[Cheese][3]' anytime soon. But as the development progresses, they might add some exciting features.

To know more, you can keep an eye on  [This Week in GNOME][8] blog to check the development updates on Snapshot and other GNOME apps.

### 📥 Get Snapshot

You can get the app from the [Flathub store][9], and explore its source code on [GitLab][10].

_💬 What do you think? Will Snapshot replace Cheese as the default camera app on GNOME for you?_
