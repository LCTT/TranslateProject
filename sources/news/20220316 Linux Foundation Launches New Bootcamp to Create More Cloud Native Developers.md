Linux Foundation Launches New Bootcamp to Create More Cloud Native Developers
======

The Linux Foundation and The Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) have put together a new offering that facilitates learning of key cloud-native development practices.

In case you did not know, a Cloud Engineer Bootcamp is already available to introduce the fundamentals of Kubernetes, DevOps, and Linux system administration. Furthermore, an advanced cloud engineer Bootcamp is on the offering to explore cloud-native logging, monitoring, and some Kubernetes.

To improve on that, [The Linux Foundation][1] and the experts at CNCF launched a new Bootcamp focusing on cloud application development.

Not to mention, the cloud computing skills are extremely valued by various employers. So, the new offering should help interested individuals, and existing developers, to gain more skills to meet the growing demand for cloud computing jobs.

### Cloud Native Developer Bootcamp: What Do You Get to Learn?

The Bootcamp includes five different courses that include:

  * Introduction to Open Source Development, Git, and Linux
  * DevOps and SRE Fundamentals
  * Containers for Developers and Quality Assurance
  * Kubernetes for Developers
  * Certified Kubernetes Application Developer
  * GitOps



The entire Bootcamp can be completed in around six months, with estimated 10-15 hours of effort needed per week.

As you can notice, you will get started with the open-source development essentials that also include Git and Linux. It also touches upon the fundamentals for DevOps, and SRE (Site Reliability Engineering).

Overall, you gain the necessary knowledge to be a certified Kubernetes Application Developer, which is one of the top-paying cloud computing jobs out there.

Upon completion, you get a verified certificate of completion and an online badge to certify your skills from the Bootcamp.

Clyde Seepersad, SVP, and general manager of training &amp; certification at The Linux Foundation mentions :

> “There is a significant shortage of cloud talent worldwide, in addition to challenges around upskilling existing professionals who are used to traditional development methodologies. This bootcamp will lower the barrier to entry for anyone interested in a cloud native development career, and will help more organizations source the talent they need to meet their digital transformation goals.”
