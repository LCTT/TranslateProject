Children’s Drawing App Tux Paint Now Has Gradient Fill and Pixel Art Options
======

Tux Paint is an [open source drawing application][1] and an alternative to Microsoft Paint on Linux. It is a cross-platform application and you can also use it on Windows and macOS.

[Tux Paint][2] primarily intends to be used by children between the age of 3 and 12. It is actually used in schools worldwide. It features easy to use interface, sound effect and a Tux mascot that works as guide in an entertaining way.

Of course, this doesn’t mean that you cannot use Tux Paint if you are 13 or older.

The developers of Tux Paint have just released the version 0.9.26. Let’s see what new features you get in the latest release.

### What’s new in Tux Paint 0.9.26?

Here are the main new features in improvement added in the version 0.9.26.

#### Fill tool now has gradient option

Gradient colors have gained quite some popularity lately. Keeping that in mind, Tux Paint’s Fill tool now can fill the selected area with gradient colors.

There are two kinds of gradients filling available. The “Radial” fill creates a circular gradient centered around the mouse click, while the “Linear” fill allows the interactive creation of gradients at different angles and sizes.

#### Magic tools now has pixel and checkerboard options

The Magic tool now has “pixel” options that makes it easier to create retro-gaming style pixel art. It doesn’t give the capability of full-fledged pixel tool like [Pixelorama][4] but at pixelating is available as an option.

There is also a Checkerboard option that fills the entire canvas with a check pattern and the “Clone” option allows duplicating parts of the picture via brush strokes.

#### Accessibility improvements

The new version has two accessibility options added. The entire user interface of Tux Paint can now be enlarged. This is going to benefit users with impaired vision. This will also make the program more suitable to very HiDPI displays.

Another option is to re-organize the color palette. It can also be helpful to users of coarse input devices, such as eye-gaze tracking systems.

#### What else?

Tux Paint’s user documentation has been overhauled and this makes localization easier. So if you are interested, please contact the Tux Paint team and help with localization efforts.

#### Getting Tux Paint 0.9.26

On Linux, you can get the latest Tux Paint in [Flatpak package format][6]. If you have Flatpak support enabled, you can use the following command to install it:

```
flatpak install flathub org.tuxpaint.Tuxpaint
```

For Windows and macOS, you can [download it from its website][7].
