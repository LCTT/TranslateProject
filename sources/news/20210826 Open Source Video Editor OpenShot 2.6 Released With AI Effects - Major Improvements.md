OpenShot is one of the most popular [open-source video editors][1] out there.

It is not just for Linux, but it is an impressive free video editor for Windows and Mac users as well.

Here, we discuss some key additions in OpenShot 2.6.0 release.

### AI Effects

Taking the help of an AI to process images/videos is becoming increasingly common these days.

Hence, OpenShot adds the support for AI effects to make it easier to enhance and edit videos.

One of the features includes eliminating any shake/motion in a video by calculating it.

You can also track particular objects in a video. This is undoubtedly helpful for animation or any other creative work where you need to follow a specific element of the video.

Like a real-time feed where the camera detects vehicles, it can also identify objects in the video. While this feature is in beta, it should be fun to experiment with it.

### Audio Effects

OpenShot video editor featured most of the essential audio effects. And, in this release, some more important audio effects have been added that include:

  * Compressor
  * Expander
  * Echo
  * Delay
  * Distortion
  * Noise
  * EQ
  * Robotic voice and whispering voice effects



### New &amp; Improved Tools

Vital tools in snapping and transform mode have been improved.

The improved transform tool lets you resize, rotate, and work seamlessly to create complex animations.

Furthermore, when trimming the clip, the snapping tool allows you better align the edges of the clips.

A new zoom slider tool has been added to give you better control over the timeline. You can easily drag and work with a specific portion of the timeline as needed.

### Other Improvements

In addition to the essential changes, you can find performance improvements and numerous bug fixes.

You can find the latest version as an AppImage file as of now. It should reflect soon in the Flathub repository and other sources as well. Consider reading [how to use AppImage files][6] if you are not aware of it.
