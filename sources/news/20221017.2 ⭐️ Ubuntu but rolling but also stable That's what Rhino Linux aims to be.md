Ubuntu but rolling but also stable That's what Rhino Linux aims to be
======

A rolling-release Ubuntu distribution? Wait, what? Rhino Linux sounds fascinating..

![Ubuntu but rolling but also stable! That's what Rhino Linux aims to be][1]

Rhino Linux will be the successor of [Rolling Rhino Remix][2]. A Linux distro built by http.llamaz that offered a rolling-release **unofficial** variant of Ubuntu.

To clarify, the project was never aimed to replace other stable distributions and was purely a passion project made for fun.

Considering people started using it as a daily driver and expected more from it, the developer has decided to turn this into a serious project.

Rhino Linux is its next step for it. So, what can you expect?

### Meet Rhino Linux: The Successor

The main goal is to provide a stable Ubuntu experience while still providing a rolling-release model.

The aim remains the same, but the fundamentals for Rhino Linux will receive a complete overhaul. They are potentially making it an impressive rolling-release Ubuntu distribution.

**Sounds exciting! 🤯**

At its core, Rhino Linux will be using a slightly modified version of [XFCE][3] as its desktop environment; it was chosen due to its well-known stability and speed.

The founder of Rhino Linux mentioned the following:

> Ubuntu as a rolling release is still at the very core of our concept. Rhino Linux is not a depature from Rolling Rhino Remix, but rather re-imagines it as the more stable, mature distribution it should have shipped as originally.

![xfce 4.14][4]

Alongside that, [Pacstall][5] will be used as the default package manager on Rhino Linux with one of their repositories.

> 💡Pacstall is an [AUR][6]-inspired package manager for Ubuntu.

The development of which is headed by the founder of Pacstall, [_Plasma_][7]. He has also joined as one of the new developers (Deputy Project Lead), and [Sourajyoti Basak][8] as another core member.

### Moving Forward: Availability and Release

As of writing, Rhino Linux has not received any specific release date, but you can expect it to release sometime in **2023**.

What happens to Rolling Rhino Remix?

The developer clarified that it would continue to be maintained for three months after the release of Rhino Linux. However, it won't have a new release image after its subsequent release on **11.01.2022**.

You can find out more about Rhino Linux by visiting its [official website][9].
