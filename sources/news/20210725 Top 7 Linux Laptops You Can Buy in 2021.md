Top 7 Linux Laptops You Can Buy in 2021
======

Linux laptops are the perfect alternatives to macOS and Windows-powered laptops.

Technically, you can turn any laptop of your choice into a Linux machine by choosing to install any Linux distribution available.

But, here, our focus will be on the laptops that offer Linux out-of-the-box, ensuring the best compatibility and support no matter what kind of budget you have.

### Linux Laptops by Popular Brands

It is often the best choice for a consumer to opt for a Linux laptop built by a popular manufacturer.

You do not have to worry about the after-sales, warranty extensions, and service repairs.

Dell and Lenovo are usually the ones who provide laptops with Linux pre-installed.

Do note that everything is subject to availability depending on the country/region.

*_Pricing mentioned in this article is converted to USD for easy comparison, excluding shipping and other extras._

#### 1\. Lenovo Thinkpad X1 Carbon (Gen 8 / Gen 9)

_**Pricing**: Starts at **$1535**_

The entire Thinkpad series by Lenovo is a popular choice among Linux users. It is built to last and offers good compatibility

However, it stays on the expensive side.

You will have three choices to go with depending on what you go for. If you are customizing a Gen 9 Thinkpad laptop, you will have Ubuntu 20.04 and Fedora 33 as your options to have installed.

For Gen 8 models, it seems that Fedora 33 is off the table, and it is Fedora 32 instead, along with Ubuntu 20.04.

All the variants are powered by Intel chipsets, 10th gen for Gen 8 and 11th gen for Gen 9.

Most of the other specifications remain similar with a 14-inch display (FHD, WQHD, and UHD options available), up to 32 GB RAM, 1 TB SSD, fingerprint reader, and Wi-Fi 6 support.

_**Pricing**: Starts at **$1499**_

System76’s laptop will come baked in with their Pop!_OS operating system which is based on Ubuntu but provides a **hassle-free out-of-the-box experience**.
