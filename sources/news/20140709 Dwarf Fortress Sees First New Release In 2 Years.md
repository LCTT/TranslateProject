================================================================================

[Dwarf Fortress][1] is a single-player fantasy game. You can control a dwarven outpost or an adventurer in a randomly generated, persistent world. The kicker is that the graphics are all text, no actual graphics. There are of course mods to make it graphical however.

I have to say I don't get the fuss at all with this one. The interface is confusing and it's not nice to look at, but I am guessing with plenty of graphical mods it could get pretty good considering everything you can do in it. I understand it will have a massive amount of replayability due to generating a new world each time, but it just doesn't look inviting to someone who hasn't played a game like it before.

This new release is the first in 2 years and has massive changes as you might imagine. See the [full rundown here][1].

What do people see in it exactly? I know plenty of you play it as the amount of people to email it in was crazy. I'm just going to sit back and let the "omg your crazy" comments come in.
