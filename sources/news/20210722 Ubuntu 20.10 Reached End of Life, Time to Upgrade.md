Ubuntu 20.10 到达生命终点，该升级啦！
======

Ubuntu 20.10 (Groovy Gorilla) 今天停止支持啦(2021年6月22日)。它是一个非长期支持发行版本(non-LTS)[带来了一些新特性][1].

通常，非长期支持发行版维护9个月，所以20.10生命周期结束意味着Ubuntu 20.10用户不会再收到安全和维护更新。

你也会错过已安装应用的更新，安装新软件也会面临问题[使用命令行][2]。没有了日常的sources.list维护，使用软件中心也将是个问题（也不推荐）。

支持周期的结束

The end of life applies to all other Ubuntu flavors like Kubuntu, Lubuntu, MATE, etc.

While distributions like Linux Mint and elementary OS do not rely on non-LTS releases, you have nothing to worry about there.

It is also a good idea to [check your Ubuntu version][3] installed with this command in the terminal:

```
lsb_release -a
```

### Upgrade to Ubuntu 21.04 (Hirsute Hippo): It’s Time!

It is a no-brainer that you need to upgrade to Ubuntu 21.04 to get the latest updates and security improvements.

[Ubuntu 21.10 release][4] is only a few months later—so you can try upgrading to it when that is available as well.

For now, you can follow our [Ubuntu upgrade][5] tutorial to get started.

I would recommend you to make a backup, in case things go bad with the upgrade process.

If you want to perform a fresh installation, you can do that as well.

### Still Using Ubuntu 20.10?

Technically, you can choose to keep using the unsupported version. However, if you do not want security issues to creep up, it is recommended to upgrade to the newest version available i.e Ubuntu 21.04.

Ubuntu 21.04 will be supported until January 2022. You might want to check out the [features in Ubuntu 21.04][6] before making the jump.

_How was your experience so far with Ubuntu 20.10? Have you upgraded yet? Let me know in the comments below._
