Essential improvements, and additions with the latest point update MX
Linux 23.2.
MX Linux has introduced their first major release of 2024 as a continuation to their 23.x release. The previous release, [MX Linux 23][1], featured a new logo, and other major changes.

The new release, **MX Linux 23.2** aims to continue in that path.

If you are curious, this [Debian-based distro][2] is a superb choice if you are looking for a [systemd-free distro][3] that doesn't get in the way while using it.

So, without any further ado, let's dive in.

## 🆕 MX Linux 23.2: What's New?

![][4]

Built on Debian 12.4 “Bookworm” base, MX Linux 23.2 **uses** [**Linux kernel 6.1**][5] **for the standard variant** , and Linux kernel 6.6 “[liquorix][6]” for its “Advanced Hardware Support” (AHS) release, meant for newer hardware.

As for the **highlights of this release** , the installer now features fixes for users of the “ _toram_ ” live feature, an update that addresses _fstab_ generation, and a better graphical user interface.

The **various applications and tools also see upgrades** , for audio/video handling, [PipeWire 1.0][7] is used, a new tool “ **MX Locale** ” has been introduced for managing system locale information, the default language, and more.

**On the UI/UX part** , the “ _mx-comfort-themes_ ” has been fixed due to some apps not playing nice with it, and **a new wallpaper** called “MX Linux Desert Landscape” has been introduced.

A new tool called “ _papirus-folder-colors_ ” is also here that allows you to **experiment with different folder colors**.

Then there's the **new camera apps;** in the case of the KDE Plasma version of MX Linux, [Webcamoid][8] replaces [Kamoso][9] and similarly, for Xfce and Fluxbox, Webcamoid is replaced with [Guvcview][10].

And to close this out, **** the AHS release for MX Linux's flagship desktop (Xfce) now receives **updated firmware and Mesa libraries** with a new optional setting for enabling auto-updates under the _MX-Packageinstaller_ menu.
