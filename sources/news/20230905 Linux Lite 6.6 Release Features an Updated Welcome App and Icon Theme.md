Linux Lite 6.6 Release Features an Updated Welcome App and Icon Theme
======
Linux Lite 6.6 may not feature big changes, but looks like it is
focusing on the useful bits.
Linux Lite is one of the [best lightweight Linux distros][1] that offers a [Windows-like][2] experience.

We last looked at it earlier this year when [Linux Lite 6.4][3] added some significant changes. Now, we have yet another point release that promises a slew of improvements.

## 🆕 Linux Lite 6.6: What's New?

![][4]

Dubbed one of the largest releases of Linux Lite since 2012, this release consists of 1000 new lines of code. Powered by the reliable [**Linux Kernel 5.15**][5], Linux Lite 6.6 is a modest update.

Some highlights include:

  * **Improved Lite Welcome app**
  * **Free A.I. Chatbot**
  * **Support for New Languages**



### Improved Lite Welcome

![][6]

The ' **Lite Welcome** ' app has been updated to show an “ **Install Now** ” button in live sessions when Linux Lite is not installed. It will now check if it is running in a live environment and display the button accordingly.

This will be a handy way of directly installing Linux Lite onto your system. The update has also added another option to the welcome app; more on that below.

### Free A.I. Chatbot

![][8]

A new link in the welcome app to directly head to Linux Lite's web chatbot called “Free A.I. Chatbot”.

Users can use that to get support related to Linux Lite; though I hoped this to be a dedicated application built into the system, it is interesting to have nonetheless.

You can also [access it][9] directly using a web browser.

### Support for New Languages

![][10]

This has been the major contributor to the aforementioned lines of code i.e support for **22 languages** has been added to Linux Lite 6.6.

I tested it out in 'Hindi,' and it worked pretty well; though some options were still displayed in English, it was nice to see that they are **trying to be more inclusive** with a broader selection of language options.

The **areas that feature these languages** include the main menu, right-click menu, folder names, Linux Lite application names, desktop icons, and My Computer Menu names.

  * VLC 3.0.16
  * Gimp 2.10.30
  * LibreOffice 7.5.6
  * Thunderbird 102.15
