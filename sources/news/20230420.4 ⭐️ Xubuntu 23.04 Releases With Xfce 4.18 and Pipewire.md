Xubuntu 23.04 Releases With Xfce 4.18 and Pipewire
======

Xubuntu 23.04 release brings in Xfce 4.18 and essential fixes for a better experience.

![xubuntu 23.04][1]

Xubuntu is one of the most popular Ubuntu flavors with minimal Xfce desktop environment.

Since the arrival of [Xubuntu 22.04 LTS][2], around this time last year, there have been a lot of refinements to the XFCE experience on Ubuntu.

Let's take a look at what it has to offer.

> 💡 Xubuntu 23.04 will be supported for **nine** months until **January 2024**. You can upgrade to Xubuntu 23.10 (upcoming version) if you want an up-to-date and secure system after its end of life.

### 🆕 Xubuntu 23.04: What’s New?

Based on **Ubuntu 23.04 'Lunar Lobster'**, this is a packed release with many important updates. The notable highlights include the following:

- **Desktop Environment Upgrade**
- **Removal Of Default Flatpak Support**
- **Xubuntu Minimal**
- **Inclusion of PipeWire**

> 📋 This is **not** a [Long-Term Support][4] version. So, for most, you do not need to upgrade. Go ahead only if you want the latest and greatest while willing to upgrade again soon under a year.

#### Desktop Environment Upgrades

The most significant change you will notice with this release is the **inclusion of Xfce 4.18** which features many new improvements that have made it much more refined over its predecessor.

Some of those improvements include **major feature additions to the Thunar file manager**, **updates to the XFCE panel**, **new wallpapers**, **initial Wayland support**, and more.

You can go through our coverage on the same to learn more.

#### Removal Of Default Flatpak Support

Yes, you read that right.

As Xubuntu is an Ubuntu flavor, Flatpak support out-of-the-box is no longer an option by default.So, snap it is.

You can still [set up Flatpak in a matter of minutes][6] by running a few lines of code in the terminal.

#### Introduction of Minimal ISO

In a [similar fashion][7] to Ubuntu, you can now make use of a **minimal ISO for Xubuntu**. Though it's not as small as the one planned for Ubuntu, it still measures up well against the standard ISO.

The minimal ISO comes in at a smaller **1.7 GB** size with a minimal **set of applications**: The terminal, file manager, system settings apps, Snap package manager, and screenshot app.

Thanks to that, it also **takes up less storage space** than a standard installation.

#### Inclusion of PipeWire

Xubuntu now finally ships with [PipeWire][8]; this should allow for **enhanced handling of audio and video** across the system.

It will also facilitate the capture and playback of audio/video with very little latency and real-time processing.

#### 🛠️ Other Improvements

Other than the above mentioned, here are a few application updates that are worth knowing about:

- **[Linux Kernel 6.2][9]**
- **Firefox 111.0 (snap)**
- **GIMP 2.10.34**
- **LibreOffice 7.5.2**
- **Pipewire 0.3.65**
- **Snapd 2.58.3**
- **[Thunderbird 102.9.0][10]**
- Tray icons and indicators now have a more consistent look thanks to an 'automatic' icon size tweak to the systray plugin.
- The default font size of the Terminal has been increased from 9 to 10 for better readability.

You may also review the [release notes][11] to dig deeper into the technical changes.
