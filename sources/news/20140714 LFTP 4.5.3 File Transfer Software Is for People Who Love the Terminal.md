**LFTP 4.5.3, a sophisticated file transfer program with a command-line interface that supports FTP, HTTP, FISH, SFTP, HTTPS, and FTPS protocols, has been released and is ready for download.**

Every operation made with LFTP is reliable, which means that, if any non-fatal error occurs, the operation is retried automatically. The software supports numerous protocols, but it can also handle a few other tasks, such as BitTorrent downloads, SRV DNS records, job queuing, bookmarks, aliases, and many more.

“lftp has shell-like command syntax allowing you to launch several commands in parallel in background (&). It is also possible to group commands within () and execute them in background. All background jobs are executed in the same single process. You can bring a foreground job to background with ^Z (c-z) and back with command ‘wait’ (or ‘fg’ which is alias to ‘wait’),” reads the official website.

According to the changelog, a new setting ftp:site has been added, the http body is not uncompressed when the Contrent-Type is compressed, the source address of DHT replies is now checked, and the disconnected torrent peers are now discarded after only a timeout.

A complete list of changes and improvements can be found in the official [announcement][1].
