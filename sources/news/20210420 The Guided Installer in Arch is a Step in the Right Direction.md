Arch Linux中的引导式安装程序是迈向正确的一步
======

20年来，Arch Linux为用户提供了完全定制和独特的系统的权限。多年来，它以牺牲用户友好性为代价赢得了在定制方面独有的声誉。

作为滚动发行版本，Arch Linux不提供任何固定发行版本，而是每月更新一次。但是，如果您在最近几周下载了Arch Linux，那么您很可能已经注意到了一个新的附加功能：archinstall。它使Arch Linux更加易于安装。

Today, I will be discussing what this change represents for the future of the Arch project, and what this could mean for future releases.

### A New Direction for Arch?

![][4]

While many were surprised at this move, having an official installer included by default is actually a very sensible move. It signifies a change in direction for Arch, with a greater focus on accessibility, while still retaining the legendary customization it is known for.

As the installer’s GitHub page says:

> The guided installer will provide user-friendly options along the way, but the keyword here is options, they are optional and will never be forced upon anyone

This means that the new installer doesn’t affect advanced users, yet also opens up the distro to a wider audience. Among the many benefits this change brings, one stands above the crowd: more users.

More users mean more support for the project, whether that is through donations or development work. And with each of these contributions, the user experience continues to improve for both new and experienced users alike.

### This was bound to happen

Looking into the past, we can see many additions to the installation medium that have helped new users. Examples of these include [pacstrap][5] (a tool to install base system) and [reflector][6] (a tool to find the best pacman mirrors).

Plus, users have been asking for a way to script their installation for years, which the new installer provides. Capable of being scripted in Python, it enables far easier deployment for administrators, making it a very attractive option.

### More Customizability (Somehow?)

While it may seem counter-intuitive, the inclusion of an installer actually may improve the customization options of Arch. Currently, the biggest bottleneck with Arch’s incredible customization options is the user’s skill level, an issue eliminated thanks to archinstall.

With the new installer, you don’t need to have the skills to create your perfect environment, instead taking advantage of the installer to do it for you. This opens up a huge range of customization options that would otherwise be out of reach for the average user.

### Closing Thoughts

With this new addition, it seems that Arch Linux has started moving towards a more User-Friendly philosophy. The new installer provides a wide range of benefits to Newbies and advanced users alike. These include wider customization options and a larger community.

All in all, the new installer will provide a positive impact on the community as a whole.

_What do you think about the new Arch guided installer? Have you tried it out yet?_
