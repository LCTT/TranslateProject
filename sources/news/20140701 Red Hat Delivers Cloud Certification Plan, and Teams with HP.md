When Red Hat [announced][1] very solid quarterly earnings a few days ago, CEO Jim Whitehurst was quick to attribute part of the strong performance to his company's new focus on cloud computing. In discussing the enterprises that pay Red Hat for subcription support and services, he said: "These are some of the most sophisticated IT organizations in the world, and many continue to increase their purchases from Red Hat to modernize their IT infrastructure with cloud enabling technologies."

[I've made the point before][2] that Red is pinning its future on cloud computing and OpenStack in particular.  But for Red Hat to succeed with its OpenStack plans, it needs to be able to assure enterprise users that they are using tested and interoperable tools. With that in mind, the company has [announced][3] a new cloud management certification for Red Hat Enterprise Linux OpenStack Platform as part of the Red Hat OpenStack Cloud Infrastructure Partner Network.

Red Hat has been working closely with cloud and network management solution providers, including iBMC and HP. As members of the Red Hat OpenStack Cloud Infrastructure Partner Network, these vendors are supporting Red Hat's platform certification process. 

Radhesh Balakrishnan, Red Hat's general manager of virtualization and OpenStack said, in a statement: 

> “As OpenStack is becoming a core element of the enterprise cloud strategy for many customers, Red Hat Enterprise Linux OpenStack Platform is architected and backed by the broadest partner ecosystem to be the preferred platform. The growth and maturity of the ecosystem reflects the evolution of the product moving from addressing infrastructure-centric alignment to help with early deployments to now be well-managed, to be part of enterprise hybrid cloud implementations.”

Atul Garg, vice president and general manager of Cloud and Automation at HP added:

> “We are excited to work with Red Hat to certify HP Cloud Service Automation and its solutions with Red Hat Enterprise Linux OpenStack Platform, to help our mutual customers build and manage private and hybrid cloud services. Our joint efforts are aimed at enabling customers to have choice and flexibility as they deploy cloud environments which can easily flex and adapt to business needs while supporting heterogeneity and leveraging existing investments in the datacenter.” 

As enterprises deploy OpenStack, they are increasingly concerned about being able to use existing infrastructure and management tools with their deployments. The expansion of Red Hat’s certification program to include cloud management solutions is intended to help enterprises who want to deploy Red Hat Enterprise Linux OpenStack Platform in a private cloud to feel confident in using their management solutions of choice.

One other notable thing about the new certification program is that it deepens Red Hat's partnership with HP, which is also focused on OpenStack. It will be worth watching what else comes from that partnership, and, without a doubt, [the cloud is the new battleground for winning enterprise users][4].
