Rocket.Chat Aims to Replace Skype for Business by Collaborating with Pexip
======
Rocket.Chat is collaborating with a video communication platform, Pexip to offer an alternative to Skype for Business and Microsoft Teams.

Rocket.Chat is making headlines this year, and for all the good reasons.

To start with, they collaborated with [Nextcloud to offer an open-source Microsoft 365 alternative][2], then [joined forces with Matrix][3], and now they have announced another partnership to tackle the likes of “Skype for Business” and Microsoft Teams.

So, what is it about? Let us get to know more here.

### Rocket.Chat + Pexip to Integrate Chat and Video Conferencing Platforms

Rocket.Chat is one of the [best open-source Slack alternatives][4] out there. It is probably going to be one of the [best Matrix clients][5] as well. It most likely does not need an introduction for users who prefer using open-source solutions.

[Pexip][6], on the other hand, is not an open-source platform that provides a video communication solution. You can self-host the service along with enterprise and cloud services.

Pexip is a good contender when it comes to video communication solutions for healthcare, government, or any security-conscious organizations. Companies like Accenture, and Intel, rely on some of their services.

Hence, Rocket.Chat and Pexip decided to integrate their strengths to offer a solid offering for organizations that require high-level security.

**Gabriel Engel**, CEO, and co-founder of Rocket.Chat, mentioned the following:

> “There’s an immediate need in the market for an on-premise digital collaboration solution thatenables fully compliant and secure chat and video communications. Rocket.Chat and Pexip havecome together with a complete solution and a strong commitment for the long-term success ofour customers,”

While they target every type of organizations with the partnership, but the public sector and government organizations are one of the top priorities.

**John Thorneycroft**, Senior VicePresident, Business Management at Pexip said:

> Our public sector and government customers are especially mindful of data privacy andsecurity when selecting a communications solution. The combination of Pexip’s on-premisevideo communication platform and Rocket.Chat’s secure chat functionality provides thesecustomers with the control and compliance they require.

### Replacing Skype for Business and Teams

Microsoft retired Skype for Business on July 31, 2021. And, its online infrastructure will be decommissioned after June 30, 2022.

And, Rocket.Chat’s partnership with Pexip focuses on being a replacement for those organizations that are looking to switch to a better solution considering privacy and security.

Not just Skype for Business, but it can also be a potential substitute for organizations using Microsoft Teams. Mostly because of the security features of Rocket.Chat and Pexip including:

* End-to-End encryption chat.
* Secure file sharing.
* Transcoding, secure/flexible access on any device.
* Role-based permissions.
* Data loss prevention.
* Audit trails.
* Active Directory/single sing-on.
* On-premise deployment.
* Compliance with privacy regulations.

Not to forget, Rocket.Chat also enables cross-platform communication using its bridges and helps you interact with users from Microsoft Teams, Slack, and Matrix clients.

Are you an organization that is looking to use a secure collaboration platform? I think Rocket.Chat and Pexip’s integration solution should be a great alternative, considering the competition does not offer the same features.
