Linux Foundation Launches Open Source Scholarship to Inspire Women in Tech
======

Linux Foundation often provides a variety of scholarship programs. Recently, they have joined hands with [Women Who Code][1] (WWCode), popularly known for their work to empower women in technology.

The association alone could inspire women to work in tech. And to promote the initiative and encourage promising women, The Linux Foundation will provide 50 scholarships to deserving candidates.

### More About the Open Source Scholarship

However, we are not talking about prize money here, this scholarship will let 50 women register for any [Linux Foundation eLearning course][2] and a [certification exam][3] for free (originally costs **$599**).

Basically, the scholarship will let them gain/improve their skills and certify them in the process to get ready for the industry.

For instance, one can opt for a System Administrator certification, IT Associate, Kubernetes Administrator, and so on.

The exams will be monitored online via webcam and screen-sharing. Also, a retake will be provided if someone fails the first time.

It is also important to note that the scholarship recipients will have one year to opt for the exam.

I think this is a fantastic opportunity, even if it is not direct financial aid. Especially, considering that we already lack qualified open-source professionals for roles like System Administrators (even excluding women).

So, with this scholarship, more women will be encouraged to take up these roles as well.

“_Open source technology is leading so much digital transformation today, from cloud computing to networking, web development, blockchain and more, yet there is a continual shortage of qualified talent generally, and fewer women pursuing these roles specifically,_” said Linux Foundation SVP &amp; GM of Training &amp; Certification Clyde Seepersad.

### How to Apply?

If you are interested to apply for the scholarship program, you just have to share a few details about yourself and why you want it.

To get started, you can head to the [Google form link][4] where you can send in your submissions.

You can also check out the [original announcement][5] by The Linux Foundation for further clarification.
