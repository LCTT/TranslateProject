Metro Exodus is Finally Here on Steam for Linux
======

Metro Exodus, a long-time fan favorite, is finally here in Linux. After a long wait of over two years, Linux users can finally get their hands on the third installment of the Metro trilogy. Although a few unofficial ports of the game was available, this is an official release by 4A Games.

It is a first-person shooter game with gorgeous ray tracing graphics and the story is set in Russian wilderness across vast lands. The brilliant story-line spans an entire year through spring, summer and autumn to the nuclear winter. The game is a combination of fast-paced combat and stealth with exploration and survival and is easily one of the most immersive games in Linux.

### Can my PC Run it?

Being a graphically intensive game means you need to have a decent hardware to get good frame rates. This game heavily depends on Ray Tracing to make the images look as good as they do.

Just to run the game, you will need **Intel Core i5 4400** with **8 GB** of RAM and an **NVIDIA GTX670** or AMD Radeon R9 380, at least. The recommended specification is Intel Core i7 4770K with a GTX1070 or RX 5500XT.

Here is the official list of specifications as mentioned by developers:

It’s a paid game, and you need to shell out $39.99 USD to get your hands on the newest and greatest version of Metro Exodus.

Check for your graphics drivers and Linux kernel version if you can’t play it due to constant crashes. Some have reported a few issues with it to start with, but not a widespread problem.

### Where do I get the Game?

The Linux version is available on [Steam][2] for Linux. If you already bought the game, it will appear in your Steam for Linux library automatically.
