Ubuntu Budgie 22.10 features the updated [Budgie Welcome app][9] with improved translations and a few changes.

#### Change in Default Apps

The developers of Ubuntu Budgie have started replacing and removing GNOME-based apps in favor of MATE-based apps and other alternatives.

They decided to do so, because of the inconsistent way GNOME-based apps look in Budgie alongside other apps with their rounded-off edges.

The inconsistencies have been caused due to GNOME moving on to the Libadwaita library for its styling and theming needs.

The Libadwaita library was a controversial addition to GNOME, that not many users liked, you can go through our coverage to learn more.

Here are some of the apps that have been removed or replaced:

- GNOME-Calculator replaced by MATE Calculator.
- GNOME-Calendar removed.
- GNOME System Monitor replaced by MATE System Monitor.
- GNOME Screenshot removed.
- GNOME Font Viewer replaced by [Font-Manager][10].

#### 🛠️ Other Changes
