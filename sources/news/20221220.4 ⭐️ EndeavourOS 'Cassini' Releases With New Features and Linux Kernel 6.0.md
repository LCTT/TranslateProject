EndeavourOS 'Cassini' Releases With New Features and Linux Kernel 6.0
======

EndeavourOS's latest update has arrived!

![EndeavourOS 'Cassini' Releases With New Features and Linux Kernel 6.0][1]

EndeavourOS is a popular Arch-based Linux distribution that aims to make the Arch experience easy.

Code-named 'Cassini', it signifies a new phase in EndeavourOS's development that aims to make the OS better than its previous iterations.

Similar to a [previous release][2], this release is also named after one of NASA's [projects][3].

Let's see what makes this release so unique.

EndeavourOS now features support for the [Pinebook Pro][8].

This was made possible by including the new 'linux-eos-arm' kernel that comes with the 'amdgpu' driver for supporting generic ARM devices.

The developers also added that:

> We’ve leveraged existing work and PKGBUIDs of both Manjaro ARM and archlinuxarm-pbp projects to create our Pinebook Pro images and would like to thank them for their continuing work in supporting PineBook Pro for Arch Linux ARM platform.

Furthermore, EndeavourOS also has enhanced support for ARM devices like the [Phytiuim D2000][9], [Raspberry Pi][10], and [Odroid N2+][11].

#### 🎨 Various User Interface Updates

- The 'Discover' icon was replaced with a 'Konsole' icon on KDE Plasma.
- [Qogir theme][13] is being used for icons in Cinnamon and Budgie.
- In the case of GNOME, the wallpaper follows night and day theme like the Console.
- The default wallpaper is now set by the 'settings' package instead of 'welcome'.
- A load of cleanup work for Calamares.

#### Linux Kernel 6.0
