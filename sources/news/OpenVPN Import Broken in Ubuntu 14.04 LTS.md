**Ubuntu 14.04 LTS was released a few weeks ago and the reception for the new operating system from Canonical has been great, but there are still some problems that need to be solved, like an issue with the OpenVPN import feature.**

If you ever used a VPN connection in Ubuntu, you know that you need to download a package from the official repository called network-manager-openvpn that allows users to import an openVPN file with all the setting and certificates in place.

This particular feature used to work in the early versions of Ubuntu 14.04 LTS, but right before the launch something broke in the network-manager-openvpn packages, which crashes the entire network manager during the import.

The problem has been reported on [Launchpad][1] by numerous users, but so far it hasn't been fixed. The first bug report was submitted back in March, which means that the distribution shipped with the problem in place.

With the exception of the fact that the problem has been confirmed, it seems that no one is working on it, or at least it’s not yet listed on Launchpad.

As it turns out, if we judge by the sheer number of the people that left comments on that first bug report, this is something used extensively and it’s annoying that a fix hasn't been released yet.

We’ll keep you apprised if something changes and the bug gets fixed.
