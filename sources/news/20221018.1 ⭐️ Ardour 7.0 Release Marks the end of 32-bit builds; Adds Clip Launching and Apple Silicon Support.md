Ardour 7.0 Release Marks the end of 32-bit builds; Adds Clip Launching and Apple Silicon Support
======

Ardour 7.0 is a major upgrade with much-needed improvements.

![Ardour 7.0 Release Marks the end of 32-bit builds; Adds Clip Launching and Apple Silicon Support][1]

[Ardour][2] is a popular open-source digital audio workstation software that audio professionals use.

Ardour 7.0 has been in development for a little more than a year since the release of 6.9 and has come a long way since Ardour 5.0.

Let's take a look at the highlights of this release.

### 🆕 Ardour 7.0: What's New?

![ardour 7.0][3]

This release introduces a variety of changes and feature additions, some of the highlights are:

- **Discontinuation of 32-bit Builds.**
- **Clip Launching feature (similar to what other DAWs provide).**
- **Support for Apple Silicon.**
- **Integration of Loop Library.**
- **Audio sample library support by Freesound.**

#### Clip Launching

![ardour 7.0 clip launching][4]

Similar to many mainstream DAWs like Ableton Live, Ardour now has support for clip launching.

Users can now play/stop audio clips and adjust the timing to fit the tempo map of a session. Pretty useful for live performances.

#### Loop Library

![ardour 7.0 loop library][5]

In addition to Clip Launching, users can also take advantage of a vast collection of loops sourced from a few hand-picked creators of [looperman][6].

Users can choose from any of the royalty-free loops, with more to be added in the near future.

#### End of 32-bit Builds

There won't be any further 32-bit builds of Ardour, only a few will remain available on the nightly build channels for now.

You may want to look around at some of the DAWs available for Linux to see what else might offer a 32-bit build.

#### Sound Samples Available by Freesound

![ardour 7.0 freesound integration][7]

Another feature that complements the Loop Library is the integration with [Freesound][8].

With this, users can make use of over 600,000 samples of audio. To do this, users must have a Freesound account linked to their Ardour installation.

#### 🛠️ Other Changes

Other notable changes include:

- **New Themes.**
- **Ripple Editing Modes.**
- **Mixer Scenes.**
- **Improvements to MIDI Editing.**
- **Support for I/O Plugins.**

You can go through the official [release notes][9] for more details of the release.
