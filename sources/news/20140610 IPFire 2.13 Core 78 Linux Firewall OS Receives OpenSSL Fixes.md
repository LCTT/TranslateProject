**Michael Tremer, a developer for the ipfire.org team, has announced that IPFire 2.13 Core 78, a new stable build of the popular Linux-based firewall distribution, has been released to implement the latest OpenSSL fixes.**

IPFire is a modular Linux distribution, which means that it can be deployed as a firewall, a proxy server, or a VPN gateway. One of the main concerns of the IPFire developers is security, and every step has been taken to ensure users’ complete security.

“There have been several vulnerabilities discovered in the openssl library which is responsible for implementing the SSL/TLS protocol and other cryptographic tasks. All details about these can be found in the original openssl security advisory,” said the devs on their blog.

They have also explained that all the changes that they planned and built for Core Update 78 have been postponed to Core Update 79. This means that users will have to wait a little longer for a more consistent update.

OpenSSL developers have found another round of OpenSSL problems, but they have been fixed quickly and now the Linux distributions are including it in the latest versions.

The developers recommend all users of IPFire to upgrade their distributions. More details can be found on the official [website][1].
