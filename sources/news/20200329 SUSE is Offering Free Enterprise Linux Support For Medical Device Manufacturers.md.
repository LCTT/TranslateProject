SUSE’s CEO **Melissa Di Donato** shared the details of their initiative to support the fight against coronavirus.

_**In a nutshell, SUSE will be offering free enterprise Linux support to organizations or manufacturers working with medical devices to combat the COVID-19 pandemic.**_

The press release mentions the details for what they plan to achieve with their initiative:

We have cutting-edge open source technology and know-how that can help others in the fight to save lives, and we will share it immediately and without charge. Our customers, partners and communities know of and share our commitment to making a difference – and that extends to our neighbors and fellow human beings around the world.”

The [SUSE Embedded Linux][5] is a good choice for medical devices with a minimal footprint. And, free enterprise-grade support to facilitate the use of SUSE Enterprise Linux for medical devices is the need of the hour.

Not just limited to the operating system and its maintenance, there’s more to what SUSE is offering:

These technologies bring security and reliability to any device they run on or manage.
