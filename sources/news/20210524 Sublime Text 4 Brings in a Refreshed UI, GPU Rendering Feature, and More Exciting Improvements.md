Sublime Text 4 Brings in a Refreshed UI, GPU Rendering Feature, and More Exciting Improvements
======

A lot of software developers rely on [Sublime Text][1] to do their jobs seamlessly. Even though it is not an open-source code editor, it is available for Linux.

This first stable release of the latest major version features a lot of changes that will dramatically enlighten the experience of the users.

_**Note: Sublime Text is not open source software.**_

### Sublime Text 4: What’s New?

Sublime Text 4 is an exciting major upgrade. Here are the key highlights of this release.

#### License Keys

Your license keys are now valid for 3 years and not restricted to a single major version. However, you will need to upgrade if you need access to a newer build after the 3-year update period.

This should help you save on upgrades for at least 3 years, which is a good thing.

#### Tab Multi-Select

You can easily split views of tabs for more convenient editing and navigation.

#### Linux ARM64 and Apple Silicon

Raspberry Pi users now must be happy due to the availability of [ARM64 builds][3], which allow them to install Sublime Text 4 on their Linux-powered devices. Mac users also receive native support for their Apple Silicon processors.

#### GPU Rendering

Using hardware acceleration, Sublime Text will be using your GPU when rendering the interface. This comes with an 8K UHD resolution and a fluid UI. It is worth mentioning that it is enabled by default on Mac and disabled on Linux and Windows.

#### Updated Python API

The Sublime Text team has updated the API to Python 3.8. This update comes with significant enhancements, allowing plugins like LSP (Language Server Protocol) to work smoothly. All these API improvements are compatible with packages built for Sublime Text 3.

#### Refreshed UI

The user interface has seen an improvement in its tab styles and themes. Linux and Windows users can have custom title bars implemented by the adaptive theme.

#### Context-Aware Auto Complete

The team behind the project has rewritten the auto-complete engine to provide genuine completions based on patterns in existing code. When you are writing something, you receive suggestions providing information and links to definitions, if there are any.

#### Super-powered Syntax Definitions

The syntax highlighting engine is now shipping new features like handling non-deterministic grammars, multi-line constructs, lazy embeds, and syntax inheritance. The memory footprint is diminished, thus resulting in low resource usage.

#### TypeScript, JSX, and TSX Support

The fourth version supports these new programming languages by default. You can utilize all the smart syntax-based features within the modern JavaScript ecosystem.

#### Compatibility

Because Sublime Text 4 is fully compatible with version 3, it can use your existing configuration and session automatically. You can [separate the two versions][4] if you’d like to run them side by side, but the upgrade should be a seamless experience.

### Summing Up

Due to its elegant UI and diverse functionalities, Sublime Text makes text editing easier and efficient. This release presents changes ranging from icons’ positions to GPU Rendering and platform integration.

To learn more about all the technical changes with this upgrade, refer to the [official announcement][5].
