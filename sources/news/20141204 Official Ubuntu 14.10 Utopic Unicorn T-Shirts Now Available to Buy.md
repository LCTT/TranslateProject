**For a while it looked like an official mascot t-shirt to accompany the release of Ubuntu 14.10 would be as rare as the Unicorn fronting it. But, today, the Canonical Store was finally furnished with the fan-favourite merch item.**

The shirt is available to buy in either ‘dusk blue’ (men’s fit) or ‘hot pink’ (women’s fit), but aesthetic and form aside the design is the same. Each shirt is emblazoned with the custom origami ‘Utopic Unicorn’ emblem designed by Canonical. On the reverse of each shirt is the Ubuntu logotype and the words “Utopic Unicorn 14.10“, helping you promote the OS from the back as well as the front — I like it!

Available in small to XX-Large for men’s, and women’s sizes spanning 8-10 through 14-16, each t-shirt is priced at £11 in the UK, $17.45 in the US and €13.42 in Europe. A little higher than previous years and, as ever, minus postage/shipping and packaging.

Mascot t-shirts have been a staple of each Ubuntu release since as far back as version 8.04 Hardy Heron though they typically see release prior to the OS itself.

If you’re not a fan of this particular release you’ll find a limited number of older mascot-matched merchandise still available to buy and at a reduced price. So if you’d rather strut your stuff with a Salamander, promote a Pangolin or look tahr-iffic in a Trusty design, be sure to check out [the Sale section][3].
