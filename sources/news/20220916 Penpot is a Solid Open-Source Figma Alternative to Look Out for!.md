Penpot is a Solid Open-Source Figma Alternative to Look Out for!
======
Penpot is a free and open-source solution as an alternative to Figma and similar design tools. What do you think?

![Penpot is a Solid Open-Source Figma Alternative to Look Out for!][1]

Adobe is acquiring the popular design tool [Figma][2] for a whopping **$20 billion**.

As usual, it is the big tech eliminating the competition by acquiring businesses. So, not entirely a piece of exciting news.

But, **what's exciting** is we came across a free and open-source design tool that gets its inspiration from Figma and does a few things better!

### Penpot: Free & Open-Source Design Tool in Development

![Penpot UI][3]

[Penpot][4] is an open-source project in active development. It is in its beta phase following its launch on [ProductHunt][5] nearly two years ago.

**Here's what makes Penpot interesting:**

* Free and open-source (of course).
* Option to Self-host.
* Cross-platform.
* Using SVG as the native format.
* Web-based.
* Featuring industry-standard features (inspired by Figma).

You can watch its official video to know the basics of it:

The major highlight of Penpot is the use of SVG as its native format. With SVG files, you get compatibility with many vector graphics editing tools.

So you do not get locked down with a proprietary file format that can be accessed using a particular application.

Penpot gives you the absolute best of open standards.

The **CEO of Penpot,***Pablo Ruiz-Múzquiz*, mentions more about it:

So, using SVG as the native format has a lot of advantages!

At the moment, the project is in its beta stage and constantly improving with plenty of skilled contributors in the project.

**This can turn out to be the most useful open-source alternative to Figma, breaking out of big tech for design tools.**

You can self-host it or use the cloud app to test it out. Sign up at its official website to learn and experiment with it.

You can also check out its [GitHub page][7] to explore more.

This also reminds me of [Akira][9], which aimed to be a native Linux app for UI and UX design. It is still in its early development stage, but such efforts are always appreciated when it involves Linux or the open-source initiative.
