In a Blow to IBM, SUSE is Forking Red Hat Enterprise Linux
======

Is SUSE initiating more competition against RHEL? Find out what's cooking.

![suse linux red hat][1]

Fresh on the heels of Red Hat's source code lockout, SUSE has decided to undertake something entirely novel.

Over the coming years, they **plan to invest over $10 million into an RHEL-compatible distro** free of restrictions.

If you did not get the memo, here's what you missed (to get up to speed):

Considering now you know about Red Hat's recent move, let's see what SUSE has planned for such an undertaking.

**What's Happening:** Earlier today, SUSE, the company behind [SUSE Linux][2], made an announcement that they would be forking publicly available Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) and **developing/maintaining an [RHEL-compatible distro][3]** that would be **available without any restrictions**.

Over the coming years, they plan to invest over $10 million into this project while **working with the open-source community** to develop a long-term, reliable alternative to RHEL and CentOS.

On this, the **CEO of SUSE**, _Dirk-Peter van Leeuwen_, had this to add:

> For decades, collaboration and shared success have been the building blocks of our open source community. We have a responsibility to defend these values. This investment will preserve the flow of innovation for years to come and ensures that customers and community alike are not subjected to vendor lock-in and have genuine choice tomorrow as well as today.

Yep, the last part looks like a direct jab at Red Hat. 🤭

They have already started the collaboration part by partnering with [CIQ][4], the folks behind [Rocky Linux][5].

The CEO of CIQ, and **founder of Rocky Linux**, _Gregory Kurtzer_ mentioned:

> CIQ is bringing stability to our partners, customers, and community, by building a broad coalition of like-minded companies, organizations, and individuals. SUSE has embodied the core principles and spirit of open source; CIQ is thrilled to collaborate with SUSE on advancing an open enterprise Linux standard.

But, they are **not limiting the collaboration to that**. They have also **invited the open-source community** to actively contribute to developing this upcoming RHEL-compatible distribution.

**When to expect:** Well, in the coming years would be my best guess as this is a massive undertaking that **will need a significant investment** of time and resources.

Though, SUSE mentions one more thing that caught my eye. They have said that any future **expectations/plans are subject to change** due to essential factors such as economic downturns, pricing pressures, the possibility of undetected software issues, and more.

If I were you, I would chalk this up to your run-of-the-mill disclaimer notice on many corporate press releases.

You may dive into the [announcement blog][6] to learn more about this project.

SUSE has taken us all by surprise with this move; I really hope this project benefits the overall Linux ecosystem and can act as a fine example of how such large-scale open-source projects are to be executed.

_💬 Well, this was a surprise move from SUSE; What do you think of this?_
