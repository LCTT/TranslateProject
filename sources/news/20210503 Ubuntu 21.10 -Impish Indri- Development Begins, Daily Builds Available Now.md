Ubuntu 21.10 “Impish Indri” Development Begins, Daily Builds Available Now
======

I was slightly disappointed at the lack of enough new features in the [recent release of Ubuntu 21.04][1]. However, Canonical is set to change that with the upcoming release of Ubuntu 21.10 ‘**Impish Indri**‘.

It is slated to have a variety of new features, including the [recently released Gnome 40][2]/41, [GCC 11][3], and more usage of the [Flutter toolkit][4].

### Ubuntu 21.10 Release Schedule

The final stable release date of Ubuntu 21.10 is October 14, 2021. Here are the milestones of the release schedule:

  * Beta release: **23rd September**
  * Release Candidate: **7th October**
  * Final Release: **14th October**



Ubuntu 21.10 is codenamed Impish Idri. Impish is an adjective that means “inclined to do slightly naughty things for fun”. Idrish is a Lemur found in Madagascar.

If you are not aware already, all Ubuntu releases are codenamed in alphabetical order and composed of an adjective and an animal species, both starting with the same letter.

### New Features Expected in Ubuntu 21.04

Although an official feature list has not been released yet, you can expect the following features to be present:

  * [Gnome 40][2]/41
  * [GCC 11][3]
  * More usage of [Flutter][4]
  * [A new desktop installer][5]
  * Linux Kernel 5.14



Together, these will provide a huge upgrade from Ubuntu 21.04. In my opinion, the biggest upgrade will be the inclusion of GNOME 40, especially with the new horizontal overview.

Moreover, it should be fascinating to see how the Ubuntu team makes use of the [new design changes in GNOME 40][2].

### Daily Builds of Ubuntu 21.10 Available (For Testing Only)

Although the development of Ubuntu 21.10 has only just started, there are already daily builds available from the official Ubuntu website.

Please bear in mind that these are daily builds (early development) and are not meant to be used as a daily driver.

### Wrapping Up

With the sheer number of upgrades, the Ubuntu team is rushing to implement all the new features destined for this release. Consequently, this should then allow them time to fully bake the new features ahead of the release of Ubuntu 22.04 LTS (I can’t wait already!)

Between Gnome 40, Linux 5.14, and the new desktop installer, Ubuntu 21.10 is shaping up to be one of the biggest releases in recent years. It will be really exciting to see how the Ubuntu team embraces Gnome 40’s new looks, as well as what the new desktop installer will look like.
