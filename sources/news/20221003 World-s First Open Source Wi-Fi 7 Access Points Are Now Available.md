World’s First Open Source Wi-Fi 7 Access Points Are Now Available
======
*The first Open source Wi-Fi 7 products in the world will be released by HFCL in conjunction with Qualcomm under its IO product line.*

The world’s first Open source Wi-Fi 7 Access Points will be introduced by HFCL Limited, the top high-tech enterprise and integrated next-gen communication product and solution provider, in collaboration with Qualcomm Technologies, Inc. on October 1, 2022 at the India Mobile Congress in Pragati Maidan, New Delhi.

Based on IEEE 802.11be, a ground-breaking Wi-Fi technology that is intended to give Extremely High Throughput (EHT), increased spectrum efficiency, better interference mitigation, and support for Real Time Applications (RTA), HFCL becomes the first OEM to release Open source Wi-Fi 7 Access Points. In order to provide a better user experience while yet using less power, Wi-Fi 7 uses faster connections with 320MHz and 4kQAM, numerous connections with Multi Link operation, and Adaptive Connections for adaptive interference puncturing.

Wi-Fi 7 promises a significant technological advance above all prior Wi-Fi standards updates, providing a more immersive user experience and paving the way for a more robust digital future. The peak data speeds supported by HFCL’s Wi-Fi 7 APs will exceed 10 Gbps, and they will have latency under 2 ms as opposed to the 5 Gbps and 10 ms of existing Wi-Fi 6 products.

Technology providers like telecom operators, Internet service providers, system integrators, and network administrators will be able to offer mission-critical and real-time application services and provide a better user experience than ever before thanks to HFCL’s Wi-Fi 7 product line, which is supported by a strong R&D focus. A wide variety of dual band and tri-band indoor and outdoor variations may be found in the new Wi-Fi 7 product portfolio.

Being the first Wi-Fi 7 Access points in the market to embrace Open standards, all Wi-Fi 7 variations will come pre-installed with open source software. With the goal of providing improved global connectivity and maintaining interoperability in multi-vendor scenarios, open standards support disaggregated Wi-Fi systems delivered as free open source software.

The introduction of Wi-Fi 7 will primarily support the country’s upcoming 5G rollout, particularly for enhancing inside coverage. Additionally, the technology will make it easier to construct a variety of apps because to its increased throughput, dependable network performance, and lower latency. The Internet of Things (IoT) and Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) applications including surveillance, remote industrial automation, AV/VR/XR, and other video-based applications will benefit from Wi-Fi 7 technology for businesses. With numerous developments in Cloud/Edge Computing and Cloud gaming, it will also increase the number of remote offices, real-time collaborations, and online video conferencing.
