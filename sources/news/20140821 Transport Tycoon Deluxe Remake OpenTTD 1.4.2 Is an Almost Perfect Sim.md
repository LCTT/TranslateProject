**OpenTTD 1.4.2, an open source simulation game based on the popular Microprose title Transport Tycoon written by Chris Sawyer, has been officially released.**

Transport Tycoon is a very old game that was originally launched back in 1995, but it made such a huge impact on the gaming community that, even almost 20 years later, it still has a powerful fan base.

In fact, Transport Tycoon Deluxe had such an impact on the gaming industry that it managed to spawn an entire generation of similar games and it has yet to be surpassed by any new title, even though many have tried.

Despite the aging graphics, the developers of OpenTTD have tried to provide new challenges for the fans of the original games. To put things into perspective, the original game is already two decades old. That means that someone who was 20 years old back then is now in his forties and he is the main audience for OpenTTD.

"OpenTTD is modelled after the original Transport Tycoon game by Chris Sawyer and enhances the game experience dramatically. Many features were inspired by TTDPatch while others are original," reads the official announcement.

OpenTTD features bigger maps (up to 64 times in size), stable multiplayer mode for up to 255 players in 15 companies, a dedicated server mode and an in-game console for administration, IPv6 and IPv4 support for all communication of the client and server, new pathfinding algorithms that makes vehicles go where you want them to, different configurable models for acceleration of vehicles, and much more.

According to the changelog, awk is now used instead of trying to convince cpp to preprocess nfo files, CMD_CLEAR_ORDER_BACKUP is no longer suppressed by pause modes, the Wrong breakdown sound is no longer played for ships, integer overflow in the acceleration code is no longer causing either too low acceleration or too high acceleration, incorrectly saved order backups are now discarded when clients join, and the game no longer crashes when trying to show an error about vehicle in a NewGRF and the NewGRF was not loaded at all.

Also, the Slovak language no longer uses space as group separator in numbers, the parameter bound checks are now tighter on GSCargoMonitor functions, the days in dates are not represented by ordinal numbers in all languages, and the incorrect usage of string commands in the base language has been fixed.
