Huawei Has Launched an ARM-Based Linux Laptop
======

Huawei, is still a major manufacturer even after its significant decline in the market share after its sore business relations with the United States.

Now, in a decision to move away from Microsoft/Google for its Laptops, Huawei has launched an ARM-based laptop that runs on Linux, **with a catch** (find out as you read on).

Of course, potentially a good decision for them. But, this should also turn the heads of other major manufacturers to follow the suite, at least for specific countries to start with.

### Huawei **Qingyun L410**: Overview

Huawei’s own Kirin 990 processor powers the **Huawei Qingyun L410** laptop as originally spotted by [ITHome][1] to be listed in an e-commerce website in China. While it is a fairly old 8-core ARM chip originally meant for its flagship smartphones, it is a good start.

You will find a webcam pop up integrated to the keyboard along with a fingerprint sensor that also acts as the power button.

It packs in 8 GB of RAM and offers up to 512 GB storage.

There’s no official listing for the specifications of this laptop, but it is very similar to [Huawei’s MateBook 14][3].

The laptop comes pre-installed with [Unity OS][4], which is a Deepin-based Linux distribution initially developed as part of a government initiative in China to move away from big foreign tech giants.

ITHome also believes that it will be replaced by [Harmony OS][5] in the near future. And, that won’t be a surprise considering Huawei wants to have a seamless experience across its smartphone and laptops in the process of ditching Google services and Microsoft’s Windows.

Especially, considering other manufacturers like Xiaomi, OPPO, Vivo, and others also [interested to use Harmony OS][6], this is bound to happen.

Also, it will be available with/without an OS as per the customer’s requirement.

### Availability &amp; Pricing

While everything sounds exciting, **this laptop hasn’t been official announced** and **not available outside China**. It is only available for enterprises and government agencies in China.

I know it is a bummer for a laptop that runs Linux to start with. However, companies like Huawei usually launch a different model for global markets — so there’s still hope.

In case you did not know, you still have [places to buy Linux laptops][7] available outside China, but a MateBook with Linux sounds pretty exciting.

As of now, the laptop without any OS pre-installed is priced at **¥8,181 ($1,276)**, and the one with Unity OS costs **¥8,944 ($1,395)** as reported by [GizmoChina][8].

_Other than this, we do not have any official information on it, but I think this will be something interesting to keep an eye on. What do you think a Linux laptop by Huawei?_
