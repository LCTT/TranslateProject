TUXEDO Computers is a well-known brand in the Linux space that provide customizable Linux notebooks and Desktop PCs at various price/performance points.

Not to forget, it is one of the trusted places to [buy Linux computers][3].

With a recent announcement, they have launched the **next evolution of their Stellaris 16-inch laptop.**

I must say that this can be a proper challenger to Framework's recently announced high-performance 16-inch Laptop.

Let's take a look at it.

### TUXEDO Stellaris 16 Gen 5: Overview ⭐

The major highlight of this laptop is that it features Nvidia's latest and greatest [**RTX40 series**][5] of mobile GPUs that offer some great graphics performance and features.

Paired with Intel's top-of-the-line processor, the **[i9 13900HX][6]**, with its 24-cores that can turbo up to a **blazing fast 5.40 GHz** at a whopping **157 W TDP** (Turbo), it is a compelling package.

Though keep in mind; that for running the laptop at its full potential, TUXEDO recommends using **their external water cooling solution**, [TUXEDO Aquaris][7], which can be attached magnetically to the back of the laptop.

> 📋 You will have to pay extra for this when ordering the laptop.

The processor can run at a base TDP of **55 W** with a 3.90 GHz clock speed when it is not running at full blast.

That's still a decent performance figure for such a thin laptop! 😮

Some other key highlights of the Stellaris 16 – Gen5 laptop are as follows:

- **The chassis is made up of a combination of Aluminum and Plastics.**
- **A 240 Hz 16-inch IPS display with Nvidia G-SYNC support.**
- **GPU options up to an Nvidia RTX 4090.**
- **Up to 64 GB DDR5, 5600 MHz RAM (2x 32 GB).**
- **A 99 Wh Battery that allows for runtimes of up to 10 hours (idle), and around 6–7 hours under typical loads.**

### ⚡ TUXEDO Stellaris 16: What Makes it a Powerhouse?

The high-end hardware aboard the Stellaris 16 – Gen5 laptop won't only appeal to gamers but also to a wide variety of other users such as content creators, AI/ML engineers, UI/UX artists, and more.

**So, what makes it such a complete package?**

Well, it is the freedom of choosing from various possible setups.

For starters, you get to pick from a relatively calmer GPU in the form of an **RTX 4060**, all the way to the **insane RTX 4090,** with the **RTX 4070** and **RTX 4080** filling in the gaps.

Then there are the keyboard options that let you decide between their newly added [Cherry MX Ultra-Low Profile][9] clicky switches for a tactile and audible feel during typing or the usual silent membrane switches.

You can also pick from an extensive **list of keyboard layouts** that include English, German, Spanish, Hungarian, and more with the backlit TUX super-key.

The RAM offerings are no less; you can decide between two performance tiers. One is a 'Performance' tier that offers **DDR5 RAM** running at a swift **4800 MHZ** and a 'High Performance' tier that offers DDR5 RAM running at an eye-watering **5600 MHz**.

These tiers offer a maximum of 64 GB RAM, mixing sticks from **SK Hynix**, **Samsung,** and **Micron**.

As for storage, two M.2 2280 SSD slots run on PCIe 4.0 x4 with various Samsung SSDs.

The lineup starts with a **Samsung 970 EVO Plus**, with the **Samsung 980** in the middle and the blazing-fast **Samsung 980 Pro** being the range-topper.

> 📋 A maximum of 4 TB of storage is possible with both the M.2 slots occupied.

Besides that, the Stellaris 16 – Gen5 features **Wi-Fi 6E** with **Bluetooth 5.3** and comes with the **[TUXEDO OS][10] pre-installed** unless you choose a different one at checkout.

The OS offerings include the likes of **Ubuntu 22.04 LTS**, **Kubuntu 22.04 LTS**, **Ubuntu Budgie 22.04 LTS,** and **Windows 11 Home/Pro**.
