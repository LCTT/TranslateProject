Get Ready for an Upgrade! Ubuntu 21.04 Will Reach End of Life This Week
======

[Ubuntu 21.04][1] had a good run with interesting feature additions. Some notable changes included [multi-monitor improvements][2], UI enhancements, GNOME 40-ready applications, and more.

Now, it is time to upgrade!

The support for updates in Ubuntu 21.04 ends this week i.e., **January 20th**.

You will no longer receive any updates to your Ubuntu 21.04 system. If you have been using Ubuntu or any of its flavors like Ubuntu MATE, you need to upgrade your systems to Ubuntu 21.10.

In case you did not know, Ubuntu’s non-LTS releases are maintained for nine months. I recommend you to learn about [Ubuntu release cycles][3], if you are new to Linux.

So, now that you have to upgrade to Ubuntu 21.10, you will have to be ready for another upgrade in July 2022. But, for that, you have plenty of time!

### Upgrading to Ubuntu 21.10

Unless you have a system that is not connected to the internet, and you want it to keep using Ubuntu 21.04, it is recommended that you upgrade now.

Your system will remain vulnerable to new security risks without any updates. So, keep that in mind before making a decision.

[Ubuntu 21.10][4] introduced many changes, including GNOME 40, [Linux Kernel 5.13][5], support for high-quality Bluetooth audio codecs, dark/light theme, and more.

So, you might want to start considering your upgrade options!

You can continue with Ubuntu 21.10 upgrade. You can also try distributions like [Pop!_OS 21.10][6], if you consider a fresh installation with something different.

Not to forget, there are plenty of Ubuntu flavours as well!

To start the upgrade, all you need to do is search for “**Software Updater**” and click on it to let it look for the upgrade/notify you.

No matter what distribution you have, the software updater or your software center should give you the upgrade option, or you can look for it in the system settings.

And, then follow the on-screen instructions to proceed with the upgrade process in a few more clicks.

It is important to back up your necessary data before performing the upgrade, just to be on the safe side.

On some flavors like Ubuntu MATE, you can also prefer to use the terminal and type in the following command to start the upgrade:

```

    sudo do-release-upgrade

```

### The Road to Ubuntu 22.04 LTS

Ubuntu 22.04 LTS should not disappoint you with its [list of expected features][7]. So, you can easily upgrade to it when it releases or hang on to Ubuntu 21.10 to end support in July.

_Are you looking forward to Ubuntu 22.04 LTS as soon as it releases in April this year? Or, would you prefer to stick with Ubuntu 21.10 until July 2022?_
