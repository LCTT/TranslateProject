#### Ligature Support

Ligature allows merging multiple symbols into one. It has been added with ONLYOFFICE 7.2, which results in new language support, including Hindi, Bengali, Portuguese and more.

#### Usability Improvements

Usability improvements to ONLYOFFICE include a new interface theme named 'Dark Contrast', the ability to switch to dark or light mode according to the system theme.

Additionally, you will find a bunch of new interface languages, such as Portuguese, Basque, Malay, etc., made possible due to the support for ligatures.

#### Spreadsheet Improvements

The 1904 date system has also been added, with the ability to share a link to a data range with other users.

Another significant addition is the ability to insert a spreadsheet into a text document or presentation.
