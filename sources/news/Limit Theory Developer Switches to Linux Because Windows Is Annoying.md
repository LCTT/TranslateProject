Limit Theory, an infinite, procedural space sim developed by only one man, will launch on Linux, Windows, and Mac OS X. The developer announced that he switched from the Windows platform to Linux mostly because he was annoyed.

Limit Theory sounds like an impossible project, especially for one man. The developer of the game, Josh Parnell, has managed to build a beautiful universe by himself and to provide support for three different platforms.

He was able to do that because the game is written in C++ and OpenGL, which makes it quite easy to port the work on any platform. In one of his latest updates about Limit Theory, he explained that he was no longer using the Windows platform because it was "annoying," without going into any specific details.

Even The Linux Foundation has taken notice of him and decided to promote the work that he's been doing, especially because he is a one-man show that does everything from core programming to the ambient music.

"Game developer Josh Parnell has released the latest development update on his open-world space simulation and strategy game, Limit Theory. While the graphics are beautiful, this release is particularly notable because Parnell has switched to developing on the native Linux client version from Windows (which he called 'just annoying')"

"Limit Theory is Kickstarter-funded as of December 2012 and has a planned release date for early 2014. When it's finished, players will be able to explore space, prospect for and mine asteroids, command a fleet of star ships, and more," notes The Linux Foundation on its [website][1].

The most interesting aspect of Limit Theory is the infinite universe, which might sound strange at first or like just another marketing ploy. In fact, Josh Parnell made a very smart engine that generates systems, planets, NPCs, and almost anything else as the player progresses through the universe.

None of these elements is present when the game starts and they are produced at the player moves. This also means that no two playthroughs will be the same.

Limit Theory managed to get all the funding it needs on Kickstarter and the developer is working full steam on it, but this is a huge undertaking and it will take some time to finish. Even if the proposed launch of January 2014 has come and gone, the fans are willing to wait, especially after seeing what the game will be capable of doing.

Enjoy!
