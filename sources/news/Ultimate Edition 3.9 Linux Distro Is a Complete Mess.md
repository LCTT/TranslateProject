**Ultimate Edition 3.9, a Linux distribution based on Ubuntu 13.04 (Raring Ringtail), has been released and is now available for download.**

The previous version of Ultimate Edition was a more down-to-earth variant that came up with some interesting features. It was one of the few distros out there that chose to keep Unity as a desktop environment, but the current version is a complete mess.

You will notice that the current desktop environment is KDE, or better yet a mutant form of KDE, that is both ugly and infective. The developer chose to implement a host of effects for the window manager, but this kind of glitter is no longer taken seriously.

The distribution comes with a couple of Internet browsers including Firefox, LibreOffice, and a bunch of other apps that have been duplicated when the developer though that it was a good idea to have multiple software that did the same thing.

Ultimate Edition 3.9 has been deemed as a stable distribution, and users are encouraged to use it with confidence, although we can only ask ourselves why anyone would do it.

More details about this release are available in the official [announcement][1]. You can download the [Ultimate Edition 3.9][2] Linux distribution.
