Adobe Kills Brackets Code Editor & Suggests Using Visual Studio Code
======

Brackets was an impressive open-source modern code editor available for Windows, macOS, and Linux.

Adobe created it as a community-guided project to help web developers. We previously listed it as one of the [best modern text editors available for coders][1].

Unfortunately, Adobe ended its support for Brackets on September 1, 2021.

### Why Did Adobe Discontinue Brackets?

![][2]

It looks like Adobe’s partnership with Microsoft may have encouraged them to pull the plug off the community project.

Hence, they recommend users migrate to Microsoft’s Visual Studio Code editor.

This is what Brackets’ original GitHub page says after the discontinuation of the project.

### Visual Studio Code as a Replacement to Brackets

Of course, Microsoft’s Visual Studio Code is a fantastic alternative and built on open-source. However, when you download the Visual Studio Code from their website, it does not come under a license that promotes free and open-source software.

So, you may have to build from source or try [VSCodium][4], a freely licensed edition of Visual Studio Code minus the telemetry/tracking.

Also, there is an [official guide on migrating from Brackets][5] that you can explore if interested.

### Brackets Will Continue as a Fork Without Adobe

![][6]

Even though Adobe has discontinued the project, the [original website][7] still exists to maintain a fork of the project.

The project’s name is subject to change, but as of now, it’s “**Brackets Continued**” to help users identify the fork.

Do note that the fork does not yet have a release, and we have no idea if it will continue as an independent project.

So, if you want to help Brackets fork and help maintain it somehow, head to its GitHub page for more details.
