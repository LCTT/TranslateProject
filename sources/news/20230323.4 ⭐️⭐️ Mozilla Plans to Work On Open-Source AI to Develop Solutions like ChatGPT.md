Mozilla Plans to Work On Open-Source AI to Develop Solutions like ChatGPT
======

Mozilla's getting into the A.I. game? I think we need more of this!

![mozilla AI][1]

[Mozilla][2] is a well-known name in the tech space for its privacy-focused endeavors and the Firefox web browser.

But, as we all know, the **biggest catch of 2023 has been A.I**. It has seen rapid growth across many sectors, with big tech betting heavily on it.

Microsoft, Google, and several others 🤯 Chatbots, search engine integration, content creation, graphics design, and what not.

And Mozilla doesn't want to miss out on it.

In a recent announcement, they revealed **plans to set up a new startup** and **gather a community** to build a trustworthy, independent, and open-source AI ecosystem.

Let's look at what we can expect.

❓ **What is happening?:** Mozilla has **committed $30M to kick-start a new startup** called [Mozilla.ai][3].

It aims to bring together people from different walks of life to collectively work on creating a trustworthy and independent AI ecosystem that will benefit everyone.

The first order of business will be to create **tools that make generative AI much safer and transparent** than what it is now, and to make 'people-centric' recommendation systems that don't serve skewed information.

This startup will be led by [Moez Draief][4] (_Managing Director of Mozilla)._The initial board members will be **Harvard's**[Karim Lakhani][5], Credo's [Navrina Singh][6], and Mozilla's [Mark Surman][7] (_Director of the Mozilla Foundation_).

**Why now?:** Obviously, the new wave of AI has created a lot of excitement and concerns ⚡

The current/upcoming wave of AI can potentially improve many people's lives, but only **if the technology is more human-focused**. Mozilla says this will only be possible when they put '_human agency and the interests of users at the cor_e' and prioritize transparency and accountability.

In contrast, the tech giants and cloud companies with significant resources are **scrambling to continue their dominance** over the market by doing things the usual way, with no special focus on improving transparency and moderation.

🙌 It is good to hear that the Mozilla Foundation is getting involved to develop open-source A.I. solutions that could challenge the likes of ChatGPT, Google Bard, and more.

Not to forget, there's another team working on making an open-source alternative to ChatGPT. And, yes, we need more of this t**o compete with the big tech clenching their claws in the consumer market with no community oversight**.

I suggest you go through the [announcement blog][8] to know more about Mozilla's AI plans if you are curious.
