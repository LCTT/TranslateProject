Opera's New Redesigned Web Browser is Also Available on Linux
======

Sure, not a FOSS option, but not a bad thing to have another feature-rich browser available for Linux.

![opera one browser][1]

Opera is a cross-platform web browser that uses Chromium at its core.

It can distinguish itself from other Chromium-based browsers with its unique features and a well-made interface. Not to forget, its gaming browser, [Opera GX][2], is one of its unique offerings that could use a debut on Linux.

With a recent announcement, the folks at Opera have **introduced the latest evolution** of the popular web browser, i.e., **Opera One**.

> ✋ Opera One is not an open-source web browser. We cover it here because it is available for Linux.

**What is it:** Called the '**Opera One**,' it is a complete redesign that **aims to phase out the existing Opera browser** with its modular approach for the overall design of the browser.

To achieve that, this redesign **features a new multithreaded compositor** that enables Opera One to be more flexible with its interface.

> 📋 Opera One is available as a developer preview. It will take a few months for a stable release to appear.

**How does that work?**

It makes a more efficient way to handle the user interface by offloading the task to a dedicated compositor thread, similar to how a webpage renderer works.

Furthermore, they have switched to layer-based animations, bypassing the need to involve the user interface thread, resulting in a smoother browsing experience.

It is quite a cool feature that more browsers should adopt. You can read more about its technicalities on Opera's [blog][4].

**So, how does this help Opera One?**

For starters, graphically intensive websites will run much smoother than before, without lags or interruptions by other browser processes.

Then, there's the implementation of modular features.

One such feature they have introduced is the '**Tab Islands**' feature that automatically groups related tabs. The tab islands are differentiated with a colored ribbon that expands the islands when clicked upon.

![This is Opera One][5]

It does look quite neat, in my opinion.

**When I tested it out on my Linux system**, it didn't seem to sort them into tab islands automatically; I had to manually make them into tab islands by holding the 'Ctrl' key and right-clicking on them.

Mind you; I tested an **early developer preview build**, so expect this bug to be fixed by the time it is released.

Opera has also revealed plans to integrate an in-house AI engine that will be shipped with Opera One in the coming months.

You may go through the [announcement blog][7] to dive deeper.

**Try it now:** Are you feeling the itch to try it out before the actual release? Well, then, you can head to the [official website][8] to grab the preview package of your choice.

It is available for **Linux**, **Windows**, and **macOS**.

[Opera One][8]

_Opera One might seem inclined towards competing with the feature-rich_[_Vivaldi_][9]_offers with some differences. Let us see how that works out._
