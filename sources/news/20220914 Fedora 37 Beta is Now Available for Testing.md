Along with GNOME 43, Fedora 37 comes packed with many technical improvements. Here are the important changes:

Other desktop environment upgrades include:

Fedora 37 beta introduces support for Raspberry Pi 4 with accelerated graphics. If you do not want to wait for the final release, you can test out how it works with Raspberry Pi with the beta version.

In addition to it, you can also expect improvements for the Raspberry Pi 3 series and Zero 2 W.

#### New Fedora Editions

Fedora will be making its CoreOS and Cloud Base offerings as one of the Editions (flagship products).

* A new TEST-FEDORA39 policy to preview changes planned for Fedora Linux 39, including moving away from SHA-1 signatures.
