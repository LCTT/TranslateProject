Fedora 32 Release Date, New Features and Everything Else
======

Fedora 32 should be releasing at the end of April, around the same time as the [Ubuntu 20.04 LTS release][1].

Since we are covering the Ubuntu 20.04 release in detail, we thought of doing the same for our Fedora fans here.

In this article, I am going to highlight the new features coming to Fedora 32. I’ll update this article as the development progresses further.

### New features in Fedora 32

#### EarlyOOM Enabled

With this release, [EarlyOOM][3] comes enabled by default. To give you a background, EarlyOOM lets users to easily recover their systems from a low-memory situation with heavy [swap][4] usage.

It is worth noting that it is applicable to the Fedora 32 Beta Workstation edition.

#### GNOME 3.36 Added

The new Fedora 32 Workstation also comes included with the new [GNOME 3.36][5].

Not just limited to Fedora 32 Beta Workstation – but it has also been added to the daily build of [Ubuntu 20.04 LTS][1].

Of course, the improvements in GNOME 3.36 translates to Fedora’s latest release as well – providing a faster and better experience, overall.

So, you’ll get the new lock screen, the do not disturb feature and everything else that comes with GNOME 3.36.

#### Package Updates

Fedora 32 release also updates a lot of important packages that include Ruby, Perl, and Python. It also features the latest version 10 of the [GNU Compiler Collection][6] (GCC).

#### Other Changes

In addition to the key highlights, there’s a lot of things that have changed, improved, or fixed. You can take a detailed look at its [changelog][7] to know more about what has changed.

### Download Fedora 32 (development version)

Fedora 32 is still under development. The beta version has been released and you may test it on a spare system or in virtual machine. **I would not advise you to use it on your main system before the final release**. There’s an official [list of know bugs][8] for the current release, you can refer to that as well.

In the [official announcement][9], they mentioned the availability of both **Fedora 32 beta workstation** and the **server** along with other popular variants.

To get the Workstation and the Server edition, you have to visit the official download page for [Fedora Workstation][10] and [Fedora Server][11] (depending on what you want).
