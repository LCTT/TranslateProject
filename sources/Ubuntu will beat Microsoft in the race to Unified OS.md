Ubuntu will beat Microsoft in the race to Unified OS
================================================================================

Canonical has been developing an unified OS in form of Ubuntu that can run across different devices without the need of different versions for different platforms i.e a single Ubuntu iso downloaded from [Ubuntu.com][1] can be used on the desktops, mobiles, tablets and TV’s.

Some time back there were rumors of Microsoft doing the same thing, they are going to eliminate the ill-received Windows RT and unify Windows to run across different platforms.

They already have a unified UI running across different platforms called Metro which resulted in a lot of heat but for the Operating systems there are two different versions as in two different Operating Systems. It creates a lot of confusion and compatibility issues as Windows RT is developed specifically for 32-bit ARM processors.

In an interview Shuttleworth told [PcPro][2] that Canonical may be able to deliver a true Mobile/Desktop OS ahead of Microsoft.

> The actual convergence will happen some time during the next major cycle – it won’t be in 14.04, but it could be in 14.10 or 15.04. We believe we’ll be able to deliver that before Microsoft manages to converge Windows on mobile and PC, which the company has said is its goal from a design and development perspective.

When asked if well established players like Android or slowly but steadily increasing Windows can be a threat to Canonical’s future ambitions, Shuttleworth said

> I think the key difference between us and Windows 8 is that we’re based on Linux, just like Android. That means web apps and native apps designed for Android are much closer to being on Ubuntu than they are to being on Windows. Many Android developers use Ubuntu, and develop their apps on Ubuntu, so it’s much easier for them to target that simultaneously.

Shuttleworth didn’t confirm any official hardware partners but he did confirmed that they are aware of several “household brands” testing the OS internally on “cutting-edge devices”.

Shuttleworth has also strongly hinted that Canonical can end the six month release cycle in favour of Realtime Updates.

> Once we’ve converged those, there’s a question about whether the six-month release cycles make as much sense. Phone and tablet users are used to the idea that the phone just updates itself whenever, so maybe we’ll soften up on the six-month thing and release updates all the time.
