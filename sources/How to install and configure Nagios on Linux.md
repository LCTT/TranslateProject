How to install and configure Nagios on Linux
================================================================================
[Nagios][1] is one of the most powerful network monitoring systems, which is widely used in the industry. It can actively monitor any network, and generate audio/email warnings and alerts when any problem is detected. The check types and alert timers are fully customizable.

Another incredible capability of Nagios is that it can monitor both hosts and services e.g., it can monitor IP addresses and TCP/UDP port numbers. To explain a little, let us assume that there is a web server that we want to monitor. Nagios can check whether the server is online by running ping on the IP/name of the server as well as it can be set up to provide warnings in case the round trip time (RTT) to the server increases. Further, Nagios can also check whether TCP port 80 (web server) is reachable e.g., the server is online but Apache/IIS is not responding.

There are also 3rd party monitoring tools that are based on Nagios, such as [Centreon][2], [FAN][3] , [op5 Monitor][4], which supplement standalone Nagios engine in terms of interface, automation, and technical support.

This tutorial explains **how to install and configure Nagios on Linux**.

### Install Nagios on Debian or Ubuntu ###

On a Debian-based system, the installation in itself is a very simple process thanks to apt-get.

    root@mrtg:~# apt-get install nagios3 

The mail server setting can be done during Nagios installation. It can also be configured later when needed.

Note: A valid SMTP configuration is needed for Nagios to be able send email notifications.

As it can be seen, Nagios supports multiple options for email delivery. The most common options would be Internet Site where the server sends email directly to the recipient. Another widely used option is using smarthost or relay server, in which the server sends the email to an intermediary mail server which in turn is responsible for delivering the mail to the recipient.

Next, the domain name of the server has to be included in the next step.

Finally, the password for the Nagios admin user ‘nagiosadmin’ is set. This value can also be changed later.

### Install Nagios on CentOS or RHEL ###

yum is used for installation. After [setting up the repoforge repository][8], run yum as follows.

    [root@mrtg ~]# yum install nagios nagios-plugins

### Requirements for Monitoring ###

In this tutorial, we want to monitor the following.

1. All Linux server will be checked every 3 minutes.
1. All Cisco Routers will be checked every 3 minutes.
1. All email alerts should go to the address sentinel@example.tst.
1. Nagios will verify 3 times before sending out any alerts just to be sure that the problem is real.
1. If the RTT to any device exceeds 100 ms and/or packet loss exceeds 20%, email alert will be generated. 

The rest of the tutorial will guide you to configure Nagios on Linux.

### Nagios Configuration on Ubuntu ###

It is important to know where Nagios configuration files are located. The following table shows the location of Nagios configuration files on Debian-based systems.

    /etc/nagios-plugins 	Customizable scripts used for monitoring
    /etc/nagios3 	Configuration files to add hosts, services, define checks and timers
    /usr/lib/nagios/plugins 	Executable files used for monitoring

The following steps are inter-related. Hosts, groups for hosts and adding services to host groups are defined.

### Adding Host Template ###

The templates defining what to do with a type host is defined. We use the files provided with the installation as sample.

First, define a host template for Linux devices

    root@mrtg:~# cd /etc/nagios3/conf.d
    root@mrtg:/etc/nagios3/conf.d/# cp generic-host_nagios2.cfg linux-server.cfg 

Edit linux-server.cfg as follows. The parts with bold font are modified.

    root@mrtg:/etc/nagios3/conf.d/# vim linux-server.cfg 

> define host{
> name					linux-server
> notifications_enabled		1   
> event_handler_enabled		1   
> flap_detection_enabled		1   
> failure_prediction_enabled	1   
> process_perf_data		1   
> retain_status_information	1   
> retain_nonstatus_information	1 
> check_command	example-host-check	; the script to be used while checking
> check_interval  3 		; the interval between consecutive checks
> max_check_attempts  3   ; number of rechecking before generating email alerts
> notification_interval   0
> notification_period 24x7
> notification_options		d,u,r
> contact_groups			admins	; the group where emails will be sent
> register0
> }

Next, define a host template for Cisco devices. 

    root@mrtg:/etc/nagios3/conf.d/# cp linux-server.cfg cisco-device.cfg 

Modify cisco-device.cfg as follows. The bold-font parts are modified.

    root@mrtg:/etc/nagios3/conf.d/# vim cisco-device.cfg 

> # The highlighted parts are modified
> define host{
> name				cisco-device    
> notifications_enabled		1   
> event_handler_enabled		1   
> flap_detection_enabled		1   
> failure_prediction_enabled	1   
> process_perf_data		1   
> retain_status_information	1   
> retain_nonstatus_information	1 
> check_command    	example-host-check	; the script to be used while checking
> check_interval              	3 	; the interval between consecutive checks
> max_check_attempts          	3 ; number of rechecking before generating email alerts
> notification_interval       	0
> notification_period         	24x7            
> notification_options		d,u,r
> contact_groups			admins	; the group where emails will be sent
> register                        0       
>         }

### Adding Host ###

Now that the host template is defined, the actual host to be monitored is added. Again, the files provided by default are used as sample.

    root@mrtg:/etc/nagios3/conf.d/# cp localhost_nagios2.cfg example.cfg
    root@mrtg:/etc/nagios3/conf.d/# vim example.cfg 

> # Host 1
> define host{
> use			linux-server    	; Name of host template to use
> host_name               our-server		; The hostname to be used by nagios
> alias                   our-server
> address                	172.17.1.23		; The IP address of the host
>         }
> 
> # Host 2
> define host{
> use			cisco-device    	; Name of host template to use
> host_name    		our-router		; The hostname to be used by nagios
> alias                   our-router
> address                	172.17.1.1 		; The IP address of the host
>         }

### Host Group Definition ###

For ease of management when there are multiple hosts, it is advisable that hosts of similar types are grouped together.

    root@mrtg:/etc/nagios3/conf.d/# vim hostgroups_nagios2.cfg 

> definehostgroup {
> hostgroup_name		linux-server	   ; the name of the host group
> alias			Linux Servers
> members			our-server      ; comma separated list of members
>         }
> 
> definehostgroup {
> hostgroup_name		cisco-device    ; the name of the host group
> alias			Cisco Devices
> members			our-server      ; comma separated list of members
>         }

### Service Definition ###

First, the command example-host-check is defined with warning value of 100 ms for latency and 20% for packet loss. Critical values are 5000 ms for latency and 100% packet loss. One IPv4 ping request is transmitted.

    root@mrtg:~# vim /etc/nagios-plugins/config/ping.cfg 

> define command{
>         command_name    example-host-check
>         command_line    /usr/lib/nagios/plugins/check_ping -H '$HOSTADDRESS$' -w 100,20% -c 5000,100% -p 1 -4
>         }

Then, the command is associated with host groups. 

    root@mrtg:/etc/nagios3/conf.d/# vim services_nagios2.cfg 

> define service {
> hostgroup_name		      linux-server
> service_description           Linux Servers
> check_command                 example-host-check
> use                           generic-service
> notification_interval 0 ; set 0 if you want to be renotified
> }
> 
> define service {
> hostgroup_name		      cisco-device
> service_description	      Cisco Devices
> check_command                 example-host-check
> use                           generic-service
> notification_interval 0 ; set 0 if you want to be renotified
> }

### Contact Definition ###

The required address for sending email added to Nagios.

> define contact{
>         contact_name                    root
>         alias                           Root
>         service_notification_period     24x7
>         host_notification_period        24x7
>         service_notification_options    w,u,c,r
>         host_notification_options       d,r
>         service_notification_commands   notify-service-by-email
>         host_notification_commands      notify-host-by-email
>         email                    root@localhost, sentinel@example.tst
>         }

Finally, a dry run is initiated to check whether there are any configuration errors. If there are no errors, Nagios can be (re)started safely. 

    root@mrtg:~#nagios –v /etc/nagios3/nagios.cfg
    root@mrtg:~# service nagios3 restart 

### Nagios Configuration on CentOS/RHEL ###

The following shows the locations of Nagios configuration files on Redhat-based systems.

> /etc/nagios/objects 	Configuration files to add hosts, services, define checks and timers
> /usr/lib/nagios/plugins 	Executable files used for monitoring

### Adding Host Template ###

A template is created to define what needs to be done for a specific type of host. The files provided with the installation is modified.

    [root@mrtg objects]# cd /etc/nagios/objects/
    [root@mrtg objects]# vim templates.cfg 

> define host{
>    name				linux-server    
>    use				generic-host    
>    check_period			24x7      
>    check_interval		3
>    retry_interval		1
>    max_check_attempts		3
>    check_command		example-host-check
>    notification_period	        24x7
>    notification_interval	0
>    notification_options	        d,u,r
>    contact_groups		admins
>    register			0
>         }
> 
> define host{
>    name				cisco-router    
>    use				generic-host    
>    check_period			24x7      
>    check_interval		3
>    retry_interval		1
>    max_check_attempts		3
>    check_command		example-host-check
>    notification_period	        24x7
>    notification_interval	0
>    notification_options	        d,u,r
>    contact_groups		admins
>    register			0
>         }

### Adding Hosts and Host Groups ###

The configuration file provided with by default is used as a sample. The hosts and host groups are added in the same file.

    [root@mrtg objects]# cp localhost.cfg example.cfg
    [root@mrtg objects]# vim example.cfg 

> #Adding Linux server
> define host{
> use		linux-server
> host_name	our-server
> alias		our-server
> address		172.17.1.23
>         }
> 
> #Adding Cisco Router
> define host{
> use		cisco-router
> host_name	our-router
> alias		our-router
> address		172.17.1.1
>         }
> 
> # HOST GROUP DEFINITION
> define hostgroup{
> hostgroup_name  linux-servers
> alias           Linux Servers
> members         our-server
>         }
> 
> define hostgroup{
> hostgroup_name  cisco-router
> alias           cisco-router
> members         our-router
>         }

### Service Definition ###

A service called example-host-check is defined with warning values of 100 ms for latency and 20% for packet loss. The critical values are 5000 ms for latency and 100% for packet loss. Only one IPv4 ping request will be transmitted.

    [root@mrtg objects]# vim commands.cfg 

> define command{
>         command_name    example-host-check
>         command_line    $USER1$/check_ping -H $HOSTADDRESS$ -w 100.0,20% -c 5000.0,100% -p 1 -4
>         }

### Contact Definition ###

The email address where alerts will be sent is added into Nagios.

> define command{
>         command_name    example-host-check
>         command_line    $USER1$/check_ping -H $HOSTADDRESS$ -w 100.0,20% -c 5000.0,100% -p 1 -4
>         }

### Contact Definition ###

The email address where alerts will be sent is added into Nagios.

    [root@objects objects]# vim contacts.cfg 

> define contact{
> contact_name	nagiosadmin       
> use			generic-contact
> alias			Nagios Admin
> email			nagios@localhost, sentinel@example.tst
>         }

Finally, we are ready to start the Nagios service. A dry run is recommended to find out errors in configuration. 

    [root@mrtg ~]# nagios –v /etc/nagios/nagios.cfg
    [root@mrtg ~]# service nagios restart
    [root@mrtg ~]# chkconfig nagios on 

### Access Nagios after Configuration ###

Now you are ready to use Nagios. Nagios can be accessed by opening the URL http://IP/nagios3 in case of Ubuntu/Debian or http://IP/nagios in case of CentOS/RHEL e.g. http://172.17.1.23/nagios3. The user "nagiosadmin" needs to be authenticated to access the page.

[![](http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3834/11198394806_4f4a753778_z.jpg)][9]

When Nagios is not running the way it is supposed to, the first thing to do would be to initiate a dry run.

On Debian or Ubuntu:

    # nagios3 -v /etc/nagios3/nagios.cfg

On CentOS or RHEL:

    # nagios -v /etc/nagios/nagios.cfg

The log file may also shed some important clue. The path to the log file is located at /var/log/nagios/nagios.log.

Hope this helps.
