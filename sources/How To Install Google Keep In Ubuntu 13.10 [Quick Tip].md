Lately, Google Keep has been my favorite quick note taking app in Android. While working on Ubuntu, I often tend to take some quick note as well. Since Google Keep syncs between devices, it makes sense to **install Google Keep in Ubuntu** as well. In this quick tip, I am going to show you how to install Google Keep in Ubuntu 13.10 or other Linux distributions.

If you are a Google Chrome user, you might be aware of Google ‘desktop apps’. There are a bunch of apps in Chrome Web Store that can be found in “**For your desktop**” collection. Unlike regular Chrome apps that run inside the browser, these ‘desktop apps’ run standalone, like a desktop app. We’ll see how can we leverage this new feature to install chrome apps as native Ubuntu apps.

### Install Google Keep in Ubuntu 13.10: ###

Though I am taking an example of Google Keep here, you can use the same procedure to install other apps such as [Any.Do][1] or [Pocket][2] (from For your desktop collection). Quite obviously **you must have Google Chrome web browser installed in your system**. It may or may not work with Chromium browser.

### Step 1: ###

Open a new tab in Google Chrome. Go to Chrome Web Store and install Google Keep.

### Step 2: ###

Now from the new tab, **right click** on the Google Keep icon and select **Create shortcuts**.

### Step 3: ###

Check both Desktop and Application menu.

That actually is it. Quite easy in fact. You can now find Google Keep in Unity Dash and lock it to launcher. Even if you are not running Chrome, you can simply run Google Keep as a normal Ubuntu app.

Cool, isn’t it? Google is planning to port Google App Launcher to Linux as well. And soon we will also have Google Now desktop app for Linux which is currently available only in dev channel.

Thinking about all these, I wonder why Google has not worked on a native Google Drive client for Linux. Of course there are third party apps such as [SyncDrive to sync Google Drive like Dropbox in Ubuntu][3] but an official Google Drive would be much appreciated.
