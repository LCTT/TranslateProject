Linux's First Space Opera Game "The Mandate" Gets a Fabulous Trailer
================================================================================
Perihelion Interactive has announced the release of the first gameplay trailer for one of the most promising space-related games on Kickstater, The Mandate.

According to its developers, The Mandate is a six-player, cooperative, sandbox sci-fi RPG that allows the players to control a huge ship, with hundreds of people on board.

The gameplay will change depending of the situation. While in space, it is similar to the one in Nexus: Jupite Incident, but The Mandate provides a full RPG experience.

For example, players will be able to board the ships they're attacking, playing from an isometric perspective, while the rest of the party is engaging other ships in space. Or better yet, they will have to protect their own ships in the same way.

“The gameplay trailer begins with neutral starship Zukov issuing a distress signal after it is assaulted by pirates. This signal is intercepted by a player who is commanding battle squadron Azimov which is loyal to the Empress of The Mandate. The player engages the pirates giving them the chance to surrender and withdraw, but battle ensues. One rule, no quarter,” reads the official [announcement][1].

The game is built on the Unity3D engine, but it's still in its initial stages of development and the final product might look a lot different.

The studio is comprised of industry veterans who worked on important games such as Assassin's Creed, Assassin's Creed II, Mafia II, Far Cry 2, Age of Conan: Hyborian Adventures, Call of Duty 3, and The Secret World. More importantly, they are avid CRPG players, they like Battlestar Galactica, Star Trek, Babylon 5, and Firefly.

The developers from Perihelion Interactive LLC have managed to raise a third of the money, but they still have 34 days to go.

The game is expected to arrive in March 2015. If you are interested in this project, you can check out the official Kickstarter website.
