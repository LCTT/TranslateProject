Ubuntu Wallpaper Contest Offers Artists Chance to Feature on Millions of Desktops
================================================================================
**Ubuntu is giving amateur and professional artists alike the chance to have their work seen by millions of people across the world.**

The Ubuntu 14.04 wallpaper contest [has opened for entries][1], and invites anyone with an interest in photography or digital design to imprint their passion into pixel form and take part.

A selection of the best submissions will be selected to ship as part of the stock Ubuntu 14.04 LTS desktop, due for release in April.

Ubuntu’s wallpaper competition has become a traditional fixture of the development cycle having run twice a year since 2009 and the release of Ubuntu 9.10 Karmic Koala.

### No Theme ###

Despite [earlier discussions][2] hinting at a thematic arc, the 14.04 contest **does not feature an over-arching theme** or brief to which submissions should adhere — which is good news for fans of diverse and varied backgrounds.

That’s not to say it’s a free for all. Those taking part should keep to the set of sensible guidelines listed on the Ubuntu Wallpaper Contest Wiki page.

Entries should be added to the [Ubuntu 14.04 Wallpaper pool on photo-sharing site Flickr][3] and are limited to one submission per person.

Submissions must be licensed under [Creative Commons ShareAlike 3.0][4], with all attribution declared if elements are remixing or riffing off of other work.

Other than that the usual straightforward guidelines apply:

- Keep it simple: avoid busy designs, too many shapes or clashing colours
- Use a single point of focus to draw the eye in
- Design around the Unity interface elements
- Ensure you’re designing at a minimum resolution of 2560 x 1600

Deadline for all submissions is **March 5, 2014 at 18:00 GMT**. Winning entries will be selected by a panel comprising of the previous releases’ chosen artists, with their final choices revealed on March 11, 2014, ahead of the Trusty Tahr UI freeze.
