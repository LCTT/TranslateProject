Canonical is gold sponsor at October 2013's OggCamp open-source event
================================================================================
[OggCamp][1] is an enjoyable vivid gathering of persons interested in computers, "a whole weekend of fun" where oggcampers meet and discuss topics related to free open-source software, Creative Commons, as well as about collaborative projects and generalist hacking activities.

The next OggCamp is to happen starting with Friday, October 18th 2013, and ending on Sunday, October 20th 2013, when participants will propose talks and discussions, overall event encompassed by Cafe-Bar discussions and friendly activities.

The upcoming OggCamp is sponsored by Canonical, too, Canonical being a gold sponsor, further showing its appreciation and real support for open-source projects and their users.

The OggCamp sponsoring is yet-another evidence of Canonical's awareness of and participation in the open-source ecosystem, another evidence of Canonical's deep and constantly-maintained interest in pushing forward the adoption of open-source collaborative software and projects at a planetary scale.

"OggCamp is an unconference, and it only happens because of its attendees. Alongside our scheduled track which we’ll start announcing soon, we’ll have 3 tracks which will be decided on the day. This means we need you to come along and offer a talk about your project, hobby, experiences, or opinions. Anything related to Free Culture is welcome, including Free and Open Source Software, Creative Commons works, hardware hacking, or any collaborative activity.

Of course, speaking isn’t compulsory. If you only want to come along to enjoy the talks, exhibition and parties, you’re just as welcome!

We will have a system in place to manage the talks on the day. Slots will be 30 minutes long, and you can have a maximum of 2 slots (i.e. 1 hour) for your talk. If you need any help submitting your talk, our crew will be on hand to help. There will also be some sessions of shorter “lightning” talks".
