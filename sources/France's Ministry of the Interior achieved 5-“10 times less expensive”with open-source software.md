France's Ministry of the Interior achieved 5-"10 times less expensive" with open-source software
================================================================================
By looking at the world, the observer is to perceive a massive amount of nationalities, languages, habits, tastes, political structures, as well as differently-developed countries spanning from poverty to wealthy regions.

Yet, perhaps rather strange and non-intelligent, all countries,--more or less--, are characterized by the usage of proprietary software, proprietary software spreading its tentacles across the globe, where it has managed to solidify a monopoly rooted into one goal: the maintenance of monopoly.

Yet, definitely exciting, various countries have started to identify the benefits of the open-source software, perception that instantly reveals the years-and-years of non-productive usage of proprietary software: operating systems, email applications, office suites.

Moreover, adopting open-source software, even in small percentages, has the capacity of resurrecting state departments and companies, schools and city administrations, resurrection happening in steps and extremely visible: first, there are massive decreases in money used for software, second, the entities adopting open-source software are independent from the proprietary companies and, thus, are able to much more accurately, precisely and sanely conduct their computing lives, essentially, becoming completely new highly-empowered entities.

The **Open source observatory** has [published][1] an interesting article, talking about the conclusion reached by **France's Ministry of the Interior** after using open-source software on 200,000 PCs since 2008, namely, achieving five times cheaper money-spending on software.

The five-times-cheaper achievement has been reached with the open-source Thunderbird email-application, while using GLPI and OCS,-- free software tools useful to manage computer assets--, has decreased the costs up to 10 times less, "**this is 10 times less expensive than the previous proprietary tool**".

As related to servers, the ministry has adopted open-source software, too, software that, packed with open-source databases and office tools, is "leading to substantial savings".
