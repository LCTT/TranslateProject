Feel free to post or email me (DevynCJohnson@Gmail.com) suggestions for this series, both on topics for future articles in the series and on how the series can be made better and more interesting.

I write two articles a week for Linux.org. One is the Linux kernel series and the other is any random Linux topic. Feel free to email suggestions on what you would like to read about in the "random article". I would like to write something that will draw numerous readers to the site. My goal is to write an article that has 10,000+ readers in one week.

Soon, I will also write tutorials on how to install some of the popular Linux distros, so if there is a particular one you want to read about, email me.

Devyn Collier Johnson was home-schooled by his two wonderful parents and has graduated one university and is now attending another. His father, Jarret Wayne Buse, has many computer certifications, and Jarret has written and published many books on computers. He also does some programming, and he has given Devyn help and ideas for his artificial intelligence program. His mother, Cassandra Ann Johnson, is a stay-at-home mother, home-schooling his many siblings. Devyn Collier Johnson lives in Indiana with his parents and focuses his time on college and personal computer programming.

Devyn Collier Johnson graduated high-school at age sixteen. He attends college as a commuting student maintaining the Dean's list. He majors in electrical technology engineering. Devyn Collier Johnson has learned many computer languages. Some he taught himself while others his father taught him and helped him understand. Some of the languages he knows include Xaiml, AIML, Unix Shell, Python3, VPython, PyQT, PyGTK, Coffeescript, GEL, SED, HTML4/5, CSS3, SVG, and XML. Devyn knows bits and pieces of some other languages. He earned four computer certifications in April 2012 and those four being NCLA, Linux+, LPIC-1, and DCTS. His Linux Professional ID is LPI000254694.

In July 2012, Devyn Collier Johnson decided to make his chatterbot from scratch. He designed his own markup language (Xaiml) and AI engine (ProgramPY-SH or Pysh). On March 3, 2013, Devyn published his new chatterbot on Launchpad.net. The bot is named Neo which is from the Proto-Indo European word for "new".

Devyn maintains a few other projects. He makes Opera and Firefox themes ([https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/user/DevynCJohnson/][6]) ([https://my.opera.com/devyncjohnson/account/][7]); he also has many other graphic design projects. Most of his programming projects are hosted on [https://launchpad.net/~devyncjohnson-d][4], and some are mirrored on Sourceforge.net. Some other miscellaneous projects can be found in the links below.
