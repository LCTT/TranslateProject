Unity Control Center arrived in Ubuntu 14.04 by default
================================================================================
Weeks ago, the developers [announced][1] the start on Unity Control Center, forking System Settings (GNOME Control Center) into a system-settings application aimed at Ubuntu 14.04.

Essentially, Unity Control Center is to be used in the upcoming Ubuntu 14.04 LTS, forking process performed in order to avoid various issues with the GNOME flavor of Ubuntu,--Ubuntu GNOME--.

Unity Control Center 14.04 has landed in Ubuntu 14.04 via the regular updates, being now enabled by default for tweaking the Ubuntu desktop.

Unity Control Center, except its name, follows the same look, feel and features as the original System Settings, presenting itself as identical in terms of appearance and functionalities (yet, still in progress).

Meaning, launching Unity Control Center 14.04, the user is faced with the already-familiar System Settings window and its contained entries.

According to the developers, the forking process is to keep the GNOME-based system-settings application in use for Ubuntu 14.04 LTS, while upcoming versions of Ubuntu are to probably use a Qt/QML-based system settings.
