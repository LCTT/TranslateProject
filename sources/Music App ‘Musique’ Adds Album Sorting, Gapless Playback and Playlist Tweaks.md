*Sorting Options Features in Musique 1.3 (OS X Screenshot)*

**It’s a good week for music fans on Linux. Following the recent update to Banshee comes a new release of the lightweight Qt music player Musique.**

[Musique 1.3][1] builds on the core feature set found in previous versions by adding the much-requested **option to sort artists and albums** in the grid views by name, popularity, year, etc.

Also new in this update is a “reworked” playlist that now shows a small album cover thumbnail for the playing track; notifications on song change; and support for gapless playback for those using the GStreamer Phonon backend.

Various bug fixes are also included, as are performance improvements in the album and artist grids, and a wider selection of image formats for local album art.

Musique 1.3 will be **available from the Ubuntu Software Center in the next few days** (currently waiting on approval).

In the mean time you can install version 1.1 from the Software Center by hitting the button below. Ubuntu will automatically upgrade this to the newest version as soon as it’s been given the nod.
