Ubuntu 14.04's System Settings received show/hide username option
================================================================================
As you know, Ubuntu 14.04 is currently in development, process that is to generate the upcoming Ubuntu 14.04 LTS in the next months.

The latest changes arrived in Ubuntu 14.04 via the regular updates bring a minor-yet-handy feature, allowing you to easily show/hide the username on the Unity panel.

That means that if you navigate to `System Settings-->User Accounts`, you will see a new `Show my login name in the menu bar` entry, entry unchecked by default.

If you check it, your username will appear on the Unity panel, if you uncheck it, the top panel displays no username.

The entry is handy, for example, if you want to take a screenshot of your desktop with your username visible, you are to 1 click-away check the option, shortly after you can unclutter the Unity panel by disabling the option without requiring non-default applications.
