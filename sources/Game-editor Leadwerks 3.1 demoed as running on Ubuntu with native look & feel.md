Game-editor Leadwerks 3.1 demoed as running on Ubuntu with native look & feel
================================================================================
[Leadwerks][1] is a versatile game-development application, currently traversing a porting-to-Linux road with the purpose of enabling game-development actions running natively on Linux (Ubuntu).

Months ago, Leadwerks started a kickstarter funding campaign launched in mind with adding Linux support to the handy game-creator tool, campaign both reaching its successful financial goal and releasing a BETA version of Leadwerks.

On its official website, the Leadwerks developers have [posted][2] an image with Leadwerks **3.1** running on Ubuntu, version presenting itself with a native look & feel, being properly integrated into the desktop, achievement significantly pushing forward the still-**in-progress** Leadwerks' availability for Ubuntu, "this is the first screenshot of the Leadwerks 3.1 editor actually running on Ubuntu! There's still a lot of work to do, but it's a **big milestone** to see it actually working, to any extent. We're using GTK so Leadwerks for Linux looks and feels like a native Linux application".

As features, Leadwerks comes with fast-iterations nature (via agile asset import, build of levels and code structuring), multiple capabilities expressed under a singular roof (not requiring additional tools), as well as being erected on top of today's standards (C++ and Lua).
