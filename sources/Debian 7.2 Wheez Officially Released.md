Debian 7.2 is just a maintenance update, but it does feature a wide array of updates and fixes for the current stable branch and a lot of packages have been upgraded.

“Please note that this update does not constitute a new version of Debian 7 but only updates some of the packages included. There is no need to throw away older wheezy CDs or DVDs but only to update via an up-to-date Debian mirror after an installation, to cause any out of date packages to be updated,” reads the official announcement.

This means that users who already have a Debian 7.0 or 7.1 installation won't have to reinstall the system all over again. They just need to perform a regular update, as only a small number of packages will be downloaded from security.debian.org.

Check out the complete changelog in the official [announcement][1].
