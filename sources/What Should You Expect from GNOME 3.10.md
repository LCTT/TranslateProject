**GNOME 3.10 should be released this month, on September 25, and every Linux users who uses it expects the unexpected, so we thought it would be a very good idea to preview some of its upcoming features.**

First of all, we should mention the new apps. Yes, there are a bunch of new applications that will be introduced with the release of the GNOME 3.10 desktop environment, such as GNOME Maps, GNOME Music, GNOME Photos, GNOME Videos, and GNOME Notes.

Let's talk a little about each one of them, shall we? GNOME Maps is exactly what you think it is, a maps application, which will allow users to search locations, get directions, pin locations, as well as to find people and businesses.

On the other hand, GNOME Music is not what you think it is – a replacement for Rhythmbox – because it only provides a simple and elegant way for using Files (Nautilus) to display the contents of the Music directory. Oh, and Rhythmbox is still available (just reached version 3.0), and mature enough to be a good iTunes replacement.

The GNOME Notes app is similar to any other Memo or Notes application you see in today's smartphone devices, providing a nice and simple way to create, edit and view notes (text and images mostly). Some of you will be disappointed to find out that reminders and checklists functionality will not be part of this app.

GNOME Photos (thanks Debarshi Ray) will be the default application for viewing and managing your photos, with integration for Flickr and Facebook, and GNOME Videos will be the default app for searching and viewing local or remote video files.

Second of all, the looks of the GNOME 3 desktop have changed a little, as everyone (probably) expected. The new system status menu, which is [something we've already mentioned in a recent article][1], the focus-caret tracking (finally), a graphical user interface for the color tinting functionality, and app overview pagination, so you can easily navigate through your installed apps.

Another cool thing that will be part of the upcoming GNOME 3.10 desktop environment is the GNOME Software application, which is very similar to the Ubuntu Software Center app, but only as a preview.

Among other features, we can mention integration with the Zimbra enterprise-class email, calendar and collaboration solution, systemd will be used for the user session, Git integration, Hi-DPI display support, Wacom support, XSettings overrides, overall tweaks, and initial porting to the Wayland display server.
