**Macro lenses at the ready: Ubuntu GNOME is on the hunt for a new set of community-contributed wallpapers to feature in its forthcoming release.**

Ubuntu GNOME 14.04, due in mid-April, wants to look as good as it possibly can. And to do that it needs your help to ensure it ships with a swish selection of wallpapers and backgrounds.

Interested? Here’s what you need to g-know.

### Wallpaper Contest Rules ###

Entry is open to everyone, but you’ll need to be a keen photographer or eager illustrator to take part as the Ubuntu GNOME design team are only looking to include original work.

The full [submission guidelines][1] are straightforward. In summary they seek to ensure that entries:

- Don’t include brand names, logos or trademarks
- Don’t use violent, religious or explicit imagery
- Are simple in composition with a single point of focus
- Are designed with the GNOME Shell UI in mind

It should go without saying: only submit work to which you own the full copyright, and try to aim for a minimum size of **2560 x 1600** (pixels).

Deadline for all entries is February 27. After this date the Ubuntu GNOME design team will pick their favourites. The precise number of winning wallpapers will be based on the amount and overall quality of entries.

Like the regular Ubuntu wallpaper competition, Ubuntu GNOME are accepting submissions on Flickr.

For those without (or unwilling to sign up for) a Yahoo! account entries can also be made via the [Ubuntu GNOME Wiki][3] (which requires an Ubuntu One account).
