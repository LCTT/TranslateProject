Great download managers are not a common occurrence on the Linux platform, but there are a few that have amazing features and uGet is one of them.

When people thing about download managers on the Linux platform, they usually imagine something in a terminal. For the most part they are right. There are a lot of download managers that work in a terminal and are very good at what they are doing, but sometime you just need a friendly GUI on top.

[uGet][1] is a very powerful download manager that has some many features it’s actually difficult to count them all. The interface is built in GTK+3, which means that it will look great on most Linux operating systems.

It also comes with a download queue, the possibility to resume downloads (if the server supports it), clipboard monitor, support for HTTP, HTTPS, FTP, BitTorrent, and Metalink, batch downloads, FTP login, scheduler, Aria2 plugin, and my personal favorite, multiple segments (allow the client to connect multiple time to the same server and get multiple segments at the same time, increasing the speed).

To top it all off, it can be easily integrated into Firefox, with the help of the Flashgot add-on, and has a dedicated extension for Chrome.

The developers provide multiple packages for all the imaginable type of Linux distributions, and you have to keep in mind that it’s completely free.

Enjoy!
