Ubuntu Touch HD Screenshot Tour – The Road So Far   Vito
================================================================================
Ubuntu Touch will be released in a little over a month, which means that the operating systems is getting pretty close to its stable version. We took a look at the interface and functions and we put together a comprehensive screenshot tour.

The general feel and design that has been presented back in January for Ubuntu Touch has been kept, but the operating system is no longer full of dummy apps. Most of applications included by default are now working.

This means that if you download and install today Ubuntu Touch you will have a minimally working phone. You will be able to call and receive calls, and to send and receive SMS messages. The browser is also working, along with the image viewer and the gallery.

Other features include a minimal Contacts feature, a smoother launcher, a calendar, and camera. This latest app includes a lot of features and some of them are not even available on other operating systems.

There are still a few problems with some of the base features, such as the clock, which can’t be set manually, and there isn’t an alarm app available.

As expected, this is not a stable version and it will not provide a smooth ride. Canonical has implemented an OTA update functionality and the developers are pushing updates on a daily basis. When the 1.0 version will be made available, on October 17 if everything goes well, Ubuntu Touch should be a lot better.

Ubuntu Touch is developed, so far, for the Nexus 4 and 7 devices from LG and Google, but it’s expected to arrive on multiple other devices with the help of the XDA developers.

If just these features will be available by the time of the launch, including a way to import Gmail contacts and a simple email application, a lot of users will be ready to abandon their current operating system.

If you don’t know already, Ubuntu Touch is an operating system developed by Canonical for phones and tablets. It features a design without buttons and it relies solely on touch input, hence the name.

Check the gallery below to see how the interface has evolved and what are the features implemented so far.
