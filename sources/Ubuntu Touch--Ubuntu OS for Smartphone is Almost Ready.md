Ubuntu Touch: Ubuntu OS for Smartphone is Almost Ready
================================================================================
The Ubuntu Touch operating system will be available for supported devices (Galaxy Nexus, Nexus 4, Nexus 7, and Nexus 10). This operating system now has a planned release date of **October 17th**.

> “As of today, we are exactly one month away from the release of Saucy Salamander. As part of that release, ubuntu is committed to delivering an image of ubuntu-touch, ready to install on supported devices. If you have a device, I would encourage you to join this effort! Everything you need to know can be found upon this wiki page. You’ll need a nexus device and a little time to spend with the latest image. If you find a bug, report it! The wiki has links to help.”

a Canonical employee writes on his blog.

Do you own a nexus device? If yes, you are the perfect person to help these guys to make the ubuntu touch images the best. Even if you do not own a nexus device, you can still help and contribute by creating automated tests for fixed bugs so they don’t occur again. Sharing is caring! It is the only way to make the world a better place.

Nicholas Skaggs also writes that qa team is committing to test each of the stable images released and do exploratory testing against new features and specific packagesets. You can read more about his post here.

Ubuntu has introduced its own display server, Mir, which replaces the venerable and slow X Window. Canonical is also extending Ubuntu dash search as well, offering its users perform local search in Facebook, Yelp, Google Drive and dozens of other services as well.
