================================================================================

As I wrote in my previous post, [Linux is Everywhere][1] and there are hundreds if not thousands of different distributions. Some are very famous, some boasts of their 10 million user base and then there are others who live in the shadow of famous distributions. Some distributions struggle to even gain a fraction of what big distributions enjoy and a few handful of distributions die every year. But today we are here to discuss about few distributions that being awesome still don’t get the love they deserve. It doesn’t matter if the distribution is original or forked or based on some other distribution, if it does the job, is stable enough for daily use and is not getting the love it deserves, it will be on the list.

### 5. Rosa ###

[ROSA Desktop][2], is a Linux distribution featuring a highly customized KDE desktop with a number of modifications designed to enhance the user-friendliness of the working environment developed by ROSA, a Russian company who also develops an “Enterprise Server” edition of ROSA which is based on Red Hat Enterprise Linux. This is one of the most customized distributions you can find on web with many in-house features like a completely redesigned login Screen, a tool named “TimeFrame” which allows you to easily monitor your activity at specified dates, heavily modified “Dolhpin” file manager, Rocket Bar, Simple Welcome, Rosa Media Player and many others.

### 4. Korora ###

[Korora][3] was born out of a desire to make Linux easier for new users, while still being useful for experts. Originally based on Gentoo Linux in 2005, Korora was re-born in 2010 as a Fedora Remix with tweaks and extras to make the system “just work” out of the box. Korora is a mix of Fedora + RPM Fusion + Korora packages, where Korora provides the bleeding edge and stability of a Red Hat distribution, it effortlessly works out of the box. Many people complain about Fedora of being too vanilla but Fedora is designed that way, people who love Fedora but still want something that works out of box, Korora is for you.

### 3. Chakra Linux ###

If you are a KDE fan and you cannot wait for months to use the latest software then there’s a match for you made in heaven, they call it Chakra Linux which started as a Arch Linux fork but has turned into an independent distribution with its own repositories, packages, Kernel and half/rolling release cycle.

[Chakra Linux][4] works mostly out of the box and has all the goodness of Arch Linux. Some may argue that why not use Arch Linux and then install KDE instead of using Chakra Linux. First the install process, no matter how hard everyone try to convince you how easy it is, it is not. An OS should be easy to use and even easier to install, not the other way around.

Chakra Linux is one of the very few true KDE distributions available, so you can be assured that you will get the very best KDE experience while using Chakra Linux.

### 2. Ubuntu Gnome ###

Ubuntu might have been the centre of controversy for past few years, especially the decision to switch to Unity but I personally kind of like Unity. On other side it has always been so buggy on my Nvidia setup and I have seen people constantly complaining about weird Unity behaviour. There were other Semi-official flavours available but none of them really felt like a true Ubuntu experience until [Ubuntu Gnome][5] arrived.

There is nothing much to write about this, Ubuntu Gnome is just Ubuntu with a Gnome Shell, I felt like it should make the list. Ubuntu has been the favourite distribution for a long time and because of few bad decisions Canonical made, the distribution should not suffer. I am happy to say that Ubuntu Gnome feels every bit of original Ubuntu while lacking the Canonical’s rude and forceful behaviour.

### 1. Sabayon Linux ###

[Sabayon][6] Linux is a Gentoo-based distribution which follows the works-out-of-the-box philosophy and it does that without skipping a beat. It may sound a bit biased but Sabayon is one of the very few distributions that ‘actually’ works out of the box across a wide range of systems.

Sabayon follows a no nonsense philosophy and everything works as it is supposed to, you don’t have to mess with the terminal to get things done, you don’t have to add ‘extra’ repositories to add the most obvious functionality, everything is there in one place, by the way you can do all those things if you want to but the point is you cannot force the user, if I want to use Arch Linux without banging my head with the terminal, I should be able to do that.

Sabayon is a bleeding edge, fast and surprisingly stable distribution for which the credit goes to rock solid Gentoo core. It is very easy to use with your choice of DE, even easier to install, works out of the box, features a very simple and capable package manager, comes with most of the required applications and it can still be customized deep down like any other distribution.
