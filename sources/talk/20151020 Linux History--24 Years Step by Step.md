> From: torvalds@klaava.Helsinki.FI (Linus Benedict Torvalds)
>   Newsgroups: comp.os.minix
>   Subject: What would you like to see most in minix?
>   Summary: small poll for my new operating system
>   Message-ID:
>   Date: 25 Aug 91 20:57:08 GMT
>   Organization: University of Helsinki
> 
> 
>   Hello everybody out there using minix -
> 
>   I'm doing a (free) operating system (just a hobby, won't be big and
>   professional like gnu) for 386(486) AT clones.  This has been brewing
>   since april, and is starting to get ready.  I'd like any feedback on
>   things people like/dislike in minix, as my OS resembles it somewhat
>   (same physical layout of the file-system (due to practical reasons)
>   among other things).
> 
>   I've currently ported bash(1.08) and gcc(1.40), and things seem to work.
>   This implies that I'll get something practical within a few months, and
>   I'd like to know what features most people would want.  Any suggestions
>   are welcome, but I won't promise I'll implement them :-)
> 
>                 Linus (torvalds@kruuna.helsinki.fi)
