Linux Mint的发行周期：你需要知道的事情
======
Linux Mint 是一个基于 Ubuntu 的发行版。你可能已经知道了。

Ubuntu 每六个月发布一个新版本，但 Linux Mint 并不遵循六个月一次的发行模式。

Linux Mint 以 Ubuntu LTS ([long term support，长期支持][1]) 版本作为其基础. Ubuntu 的 LTS 版本每两年发布一次，所以 **你将会每两年得到一个 Mint 的主要发行版本** (比如 Mint 19, 20, 21 等).

与 Ubuntu LTS 版本一样，一个主要的 Linux Mint 版本也被支持五年。虽然在这期间有 **三个小更新版本** (Mint 20.1, 20.2, 20.3).

与 Ubuntu 相比，Linux Mint 的更新时间是多久？你应该在什么时候等待 Linux Mint 的升级？当有新版本的时候，你应该升级到新版本吗？

在这里，让我强调所有以下这些关于 Linux Mint 的发行周期的必要细节。

### Linux Mint 的发行周期

Ubuntu 每两年发布一个长期支持版本。之后很快就会有一个 Mint 版本。换句话说，你每两年就会得到一个新的 Mint 发行版。

所以，Linux Mint 20 是在 2020 年基于 Ubuntu 20.04 发行的，Mint 21 是在 2022 年基于 Ubuntu 22.04 发行的。

与 Ubuntu 不同，Mint 没有严格的发行时间表。没有事先确定的发行日期。新版本在其开发者认为准备好的时候就会到来。

#### Point Releases

In between the two (major) version releases of Mint, there are three point releases that arrive at an interval of six months.

So, Mint 20 (or 20.0) was released in June ’20. Mint 20.1 came in December’20, Mint 20.2 in June’21 and Mint 20.3 in December’21. After that, the Mint team works on developing the next major release.

What do these point releases have? A new version of the desktop environment, containing mostly visual changes in the UI. It may also feature new applications sometimes.

The upgrade to the point release is optional. You can choose to stay with 20.1 and not upgrade it to 20.2 and 20.3. This is preferred by people who don’t like frequent (visual) changes to their systems.

After the last point release (XX.03), your system will only get security and maintenance updates for installed software. You won’t get new major versions of the desktop environment and some other software like GIMP or LibreOffice.

#### Support Cycle

Not all Ubuntu-based distributions give you the same update cycle benefit as Canonical’s Ubuntu. Many Ubuntu-based distributions and the [official flavours][2] provide support for up to 3 years.

Fortunately, for **Linux Mint**, you get the same update perks as Ubuntu.

**Each Linux Mint release is supported for five years**. After that, you must upgrade to the next version or install the newer version afresh.

For example, Mint 20 was released in 2020, a few months after Ubuntu 20.04. Ubuntu 20.04 LTS is supported till 2025 and thus Mint 20 series is also supported till 2025.

All point releases of a series are supported till the same date. Mint 20.1, 20.2, and 20.3 will all be supported till 2025.

Similarly, Ubuntu 22.04 LTS will be supported until April 2027. You can expect the update cycle for Linux Mint 21 series (based on Ubuntu 22.04) until the same timeline.

**To summarize:**

* You get a new major version of Linux Mint every two years
* Each major version is supported for five years
* Each major release (version XX) is followed by three point releases (XX.1, XX.2, XX.3) before the next major release
* The point releases (XX.1, XX.2, XX.3) are supported till the same time as their major version (XX)

### When Should You Upgrade Linux Mint?

That totally depends on you.

A new major version comes every two years. If you can choose to upgrade it then or you can stay with your current version for its entire lifecycle of five years.

Unless you want access to the latest features and improvements, you can choose not to upgrade your Linux Mint installation to another major version.

For point releases, you may or may not choose to update. Like, 20 to 20.1 or 20.1 to 20.2. You will still get important security and maintenance updates even if you are not using the latest point release.

You can refer to our [Linux Mint upgrade guide][3] for help.

### Linux Mint Versioning and Naming

Unlike Ubuntu’s flavours, Linux Mint has a different numbering scheme. Linux Mint likes to bump up the number with every Ubuntu LTS release.

In other words:

Linux Mint 19 → **Ubuntu 18.04 LTS**

Linux Mint 20 → **Ubuntu 20.04 LTS**

Linux Mint 21 → **Ubuntu 22.04 LTS**

So, you should steer clear of the following confusion:

*Linux Mint 20 was based on Ubuntu 20.04 does not mean that Linux Mint 21 will be based on Ubuntu 21.04.*

Furthermore, every release has **three-point releases**, with minor updates to the core and potential upgrades to some Linux Mint applications.

Now, coming to its **naming scheme**:

Every Linux Mint release, be it minor or major, has a codename. Usually, it is a female name, normally of Greek or Latin origin.

Like Ubuntu, there is a pattern in the codename as well. The codenames are in alphabetically increasing order for the major releases. When it comes to point releases, you will find a new name starting with the same alphabet.

For example, Mint 20 was called **Ulyana**, with 20.1 as **Ulyssa**, 20.2 as **Uma**, and 20.3 **Una**. Similarly, Mint 19 series had codenames starting with T.

At the time of writing this, Mint 21 (the latest release) codename starts with **V,** and the first release of the 21 series is called **Vanessa**.

There will be at least three more minor releases in the Mint 21 series, and they will be released every six months until the next Mint major release in 2024. And they all will have a codename starting with the letter V.

### Keep it Minty

I hope this article clears any confusion with Linux Mint upgrades and educates you more about the release and update cycle on Linux Mint.
