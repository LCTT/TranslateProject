_Brief: Linux may have just 2% in the desktop market share, but when it comes to supercomputers, Linux is simply ruling it with over 99% of the share._

Linux running on more than 99% of the top 500 fastest supercomputers in the world is no surprise. If you followed our previous reports, in the year 2015, [Linux was running on more than 97% of the top 500 supercomputers][13]. This year, it just got better.

This information is collected by an independent organization [Top500][14] that publishes the details about the top 500 fastest supercomputers known to them, twice a year. You can [go the website and filter out the list][15] based on country, OS type used, vendors etc. Don’t worry, I’ll do it for you to present some of the most interesting facts from this year’s list.

### LINUX GOT 498 OUT OF 500

If I have to break it down in numbers, 498 out of the top 500 supercomputers run Linux. Rest of the two supercomputers run Unix-based OS. Windows, which was running on 1 supercomputer until last year, is nowhere in the list this year. Perhaps, none of the supercomputers can run Windows 10 (pun intended).

To summarize the list of top 500 supercomputers based on OS this year:

*   Linux: 498
*   Unix: 2
*   Windows: 0

To give you a year wise summary of Linux shares on the top 500 supercomputers:

*   In 2012: 94%
*   In [2013][6]: 95%
*   In [2014][7]: 97%
*   In [2015][8]: 97.2%
*   In 2016: 99.6%
*   In 2017: ???

In addition to that, first 380 fastest supercomputers run Linux, including of course the fastest supercomputer based in China. Unix is used by the 386th and 387th ranked supercomputers also based in China.

### SOME OTHER INTERESTING STATS ABOUT FASTEST SUPERCOMPUTERS

Moving Linux aside, I was looking at the list and thought of sharing some other interesting stats with you.

*   World’s fastest supercomputer is [Sunway TaihuLight][9]. It based in [National Supercomputing Center in Wuxi][10], China. It has a speed of 93PFLOPS.
*   World’s second fastest supercomputer is also based in China ([Tianhe-2][11]) while the third spot is taken by US based Titan.
*   Out of the top 10 fastest supercomputers, USA has 5, Japan and China have 2 each while Switzerland has 1.
*   US and China both have 171 supercomputers each in the list of the top 500 supercomputers.
*   Japan has 27, France has 20, while India, Russia and Saudi Arabia has 5 supercomputers in the list.

Some interesting facts, isn’t it? You can filter out your own list [here][18] to further details. For the moment I am happy to brag about Linux running on 99% of the top 500 supercomputers and look forward to a perfect score of 100% next year.

While you are reading it, do share this article on social media. It’s an achievement for Linux and we got to show off :P
