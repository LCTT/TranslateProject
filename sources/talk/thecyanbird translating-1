WinWorld – A Large Collection Of Defunct OSs, Software And Games
======

![](https://www.ostechnix.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/WinWorld-720x340.jpeg)

The other day, I was testing **Dosbox** which is used to [**run MS-DOS games and programs in Linux**][1]. While searching for some classic programs like Turbo C++, I stumbled upon a website named **WinWorld**. I went through a few links in this site and quite surprised. WinWorld has a plenty of good-old and classic OSs, software, applications, development tools, games and a lot of other miscellaneous utilities which are abandoned by the developers a long time ago. It is an online museum run by community members, volunteers and is dedicated to the preservation and sharing of vintage, abandoned, and pre-release software.

WinWorld was started back in 2003 and its founder claims that the idea to start this site inspired by Yahoo briefcases. The primary purpose of this site is to preserve and share old software. Over the years, many people volunteered to improve this site in numerous ways and the collection of old software in WinWorld has grown exponentially. The entire WinWorld library is free, open and available to everyone.

Also, WinWorld hosts a huge collection of old software, system applications, development tools and games. Go and check them out as well.

To be honest, I don’t even know the existence of most of the stuffs listed in this site. Some of the tools listed here were released years before I was born.

Just in case, If you ever in need of or wanted to test a classic stuff (be it a game, software, OS), look nowhere, just head over to WinWorld library and download them that you want to explore. Good luck!
