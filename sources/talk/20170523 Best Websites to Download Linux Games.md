![Websites to download Linux games][2]

First and foremost, look into your Linux distribution's software center (if it has one). You should find plenty of games there already.

But that doesn't mean you should restrict yourself to the software center. Let me list you some websites to download Linux games.

#### 1. Steam

If you are a seasoned gamer, you have heard about Steam. Yes, if you don't know it already, Steam is available for Linux. Steam recommends Ubuntu but it should run on other major distributions too. And if you are really psyched up about Steam, there is even a dedicated operating system for playing Steam games - [SteamOS][3]. We covered it last year in the [Best Linux Gaming Distribution][4] article.

![Steam Store][5]

Steam has the largest games store for Linux. While writing this article, it has exactly 3487 games on Linux platform and that's really huge. You can find games from wide range of genre. As for [Digital Rights Management][6], most of the Steam games have some kind of DRM.

For using Steam either you will have to install the [Steam client][7] on your Linux distribution or use SteamOS. One of the advantages of Steam is that, after your initial setup, for most of the games you wouldn't need to worry about dependencies and complex installation process. Steam client will do the heavy tasks for you.
