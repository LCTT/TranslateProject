*** ***State-run Indian Telephone Industries (ITI) Limited has signed an agreement with Bengaluru-based system integrator Connectivity Solutions (CS) for its cloud business in India.

In collaboration with Connectivity Solutions, the company on Thursday launched its cloud services and solutions platform for central and state government entities, banks, public sector undertakings, small and medium enterprises and startups in India.

The newly launched cloud services include Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS), Software as a Service (SaaS) and Storage as a Service (STaaS).

While ITI will host these services at its data center, Connectivity Solutions will provide support with cloud infrastructure, R&amp;D capabilities and technical manpower.

“ITI has been in the data center business for the last 10 years with Government of India organizations and private companies. The new cloud service offered by ITI Data Center are expected to provide end-to-end IT infrastructure including new age cloud services to all its customers in the coming years. The initiative also exhibits ITI’s commitment to the Government of India’s flagship initiatives like Digital India, Make in India and Smart City,” said K. Alagesan, Chairman and Managing Director, ITI Limited.

**India govt mandates storing all data within the country**

The ITI cloud initiative is one of the outcomes of the guidelines recommended by Government of India in 2017 on setting up of IT infrastructure by government departments using cloud computing technology with a clause mandating that all data must be stored within the country. The cloud services of ITI Data Center will enable PSU canks, central &amp; state government undertakings, MNCs, corporates and large enterprises to have their data located within the country.

ITI’s data centre is equipped to host, operate and administer an authentication portal with services like Authentication User Agency, Authentication Service Agency, KYC Service Agency, etc. on the SaaS model.

Commenting on its association with ITI Limited, Narasimha Murthy, MD &amp; CEO, Connectivity Solutions, said: “With the commoditization of cloud, we can utilize ITI’s experience and make available the cloud services to the masses.”

“We intend to work closely with major cloud providers, Independent Software Vendors (ISVs) to drive cloud consumption,” he added.

ITI Limited is a public sector undertaking in the telecommunications technology segment. The company has manufacturing facilities in Bengaluru, Naini, Rae Bareli, Mankapur and Palakkad along with an R&amp;D centre in Bengaluru and eight regional offices in India, as well as 17 area offices spread across the country.
