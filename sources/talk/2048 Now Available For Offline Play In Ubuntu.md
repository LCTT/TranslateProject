2048 Now Available For Offline Play In Ubuntu

2048 is the latest fad worldwide. This tiny game is played by moving the tiles up and down, left and right. The aim of this puzzle game is to reach 2048 by combining tiles with matching number. So 2+2 becomes 4, 4+4 becomes 16 and so on. Sounds simple but trust me its hell of an addictive game.

[2048][1], which is based on another similar and popular game [3][2], is available on Android, iOS, Windows and web browser. To play the game in web browser you would have needed an active internet connection until now. But thanks to [Lffl][3], we have 2048 packaged for offline play.

You can download the .deb installer and install it in Ubuntu and (I hope) other Ubuntu based distributions. You can search for the game in Unity dash like any other program. There is one problem though. The game opens in a web browser rather than in its own GUI. It is still fine in my opinion as long as you get to play the game without the internet. Your score will be saved between sessions so you can keep track of your high score.

- [Download 2048 for Ubuntu and Linux Mint][4]

Oh! For [Doctor Who][5] fans, we have similar game with Doctor Who characters. Try [2048 Doctor Who edition][6].
