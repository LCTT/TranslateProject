Know your inner quantum with open leadership
======

This isn't an article about quantum computing. I was watching _Ant-Man and The Wasp: Quantumania_ and this line of dialogue got me thinking:

> "If there is one thing life has taught me, it's that there's always room to grow."

It made me think about quantum concepts. I've always believed in continuous improvement and trusted that there is always room for improvement. I believe you must have a passion for personal growth, be able to contribute to your well-being, and look for opportunities that are helpful to organizations.

The word "quantum" is mesmerizing, strange, and scintillating. It means the "smallest discrete unit of a phenomenon." For me, it's about a mindset. It's the idea that thinking has power and that thinking power has the potential to affect reality. Quantum computing and quantum theories are moving towards becoming reality. If you take the time to learn from it, you can understand your inner quantum.

In this supersonic age of competition, technology is evolving every day. It is going through a revolution, and it is changing the paradigms. There are numerous questions and uncertainties. Leaders are expected to play a bigger role in these dynamics. In addition, when it comes to oneself, there are eternal questions that pop up. Who am I? What is my purpose as a human being? Why do I exist? How can I make a difference?

I do not want to sound philosophical here, nor am I an expert on quantum theories. However, as a transformation leader, I would like to share my thoughts around knowing one's inner quantum self and how it can lead to a better version of ourselves. In addition, I explain how it can contribute to an organization's success, behavior, and culture.

[Leadership][1] starts with leading yourself before leading others. Being a good leader requires being a good person and the need to be authentic. Leaders should have a desire to create a better future. Leaders should be a person of integrity who can inspire others, show the way forward, take on challenges, and rise to the occasion. Below are key characteristic approaches that can guide your thinking to the inner quantum phenomenon. This can help your self-consciousness unlock your inner potential for greater good. It is all connected!

### Mind and intuition

Your mind is very powerful. Its power is used to find answers to eternal questions. Leaders listen to the problem and with an open mind, form creative insights. After careful thinking, they provide a solution. Yes, it's a slow and long process, but it is a much-needed one. Moreover, that is how they build intuition. This happens due to deeper mind power. Ultimately, it creates intrinsic energy.

### Awareness

The more you know about yourself, the more you become aware of your surroundings. Going deeper into self-knowledge helps to focus more on progress. A single person with clarity of conscience and the willingness to speak up can make a huge difference.

Awareness leads to desire, knowledge, and understanding. A crystal clear awareness with purpose and positive vibes creates an influential aura with [empathy][3]. You should surround yourself with people of your community that share the same interests and desires.

### Alignment

Contributing to a greater good is a deep and fundamental human need. Alignment is a key aspect to keep up with vision, values, strategy, and change. If you want to have the right alignment you should start asking "why" questions.

Everyone is uniquely different and diverse. Bringing a community together and having a common goal leads to empowerment, autonomy, and a sense of purpose. It takes one person to change the conscience of an organization. When a leader, skillfully brings a voice and a vision, others will follow.

### Honesty, kindness, and humility

The social media era is changing everything. It is changing how you react to situations, how you think, and how you interact with others. Being honest, kind, and humble in day-to-day work helps you react to changing dynamics. It creates positivity. To bring more positivity one must train to expect them to occur. It sets the tone for engagement, collaboration, and involvement. Always follow this logic: add your plus (positives) and subtract your minus (negatives)!

### Gratitude

A simple "thank you" brings a smile to people's faces and creates a special moment. The quality of being thankful and showing appreciation embraces the purpose of fulfillment. Practicing gratitude boosts relationships and partnerships. It focuses on positive aspects of day-to-day life.

Studies show, leaders who practice gratitude as their attitude are more effective, influential, and respected. It builds goodwill and a culture of innovation with a high degree of collaboration.

### Energy

Turn up your enthusiasm and energy. The more energy you put out, the more you get back. Focus your energy on what you like and what you want to do. Knowing what motivates and demotivates you, activates your energy. This is a driving factor for increased speed and agility. If you have positive energy, others react in a good way to that energy.

Learning from quantum concepts can lead to characteristics that future leaders need. It provides everyone with an opportunity to reflect, fine-tune, and handle complex problem-solving. It enlightens conscious and subconscious thinking. Finding new avenues for growth and building on existing strengths is key for leaders. You can bring certain things into reality if you have positive energy.
