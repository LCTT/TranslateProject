Fragmentation is Why Linux Hasn’t Succeeded on Desktop: Linus Torvalds
======

**Brief: Linus Torvalds has finally spoken his mind over why Linux that rules the servers and the clouds has not succeeded on the desktop front.**

![Linus Torvalds voices his opinion on why desktop Linux didn't succeed][1]

Too many cooks spoil the broth.

Too many choices overwhelm the consumer/customer/user.

Too many desktop choices held Linux back from succeeding as a desktop operating system? Linux creator Linus Torvalds certainly thinks so.

In an interview with [TFiR][2], Torvalds expressed his views on the ‘failure’ of desktop Linux.

> I still wish we were better at having a standardize desktop that goes across all the distributions… It’s not a kernel issue. It’s more of a personal annoyance how the fragmentation of the different vendors have, I think, held the desktop back a bit.

You can watch the entire interview on [TFiR’s YouTube channel][3]. It’s a short video where Torvalds has expressed his views on desktop Linux and Chromebooks.

### Chromebooks and Android are the future of desktop Linux!

When I met Jim Zemlin, executive director of the Linux Foundation, at Open Source Summit in 2017, I asked him why Linux Foundation doesn’t work on creating an affordable Linux laptop for masses. Jim answered that Chromebooks are essentially Linux desktop and they are doing exactly that so there is no need of going after a new entry-level Linux laptop.

Interestingly, Torvalds also puts his weight behind Chromebooks (and Android).

> It seems to be that Chromebooks and Android are the paths towards the desktop.

In case you didn’t know, [Chromebooks will soon be able to run native Debian apps][4]. Using Chromebook will give a slightly better ‘Linux feel’. For now, Chromebooks and Chrome OS are nowhere close to the traditional desktop feel despite the fact they run on top of the Linux kernel.

### What do you think?

I, along with many other Linux users, have felt the same reason behind the not-so-successful state of the desktop Linux. There are too many choices available when it comes to desktop Linux and this is overwhelming to the new users to the extent that they just avoid using it.

Do I feel vindicated that Torvalds thinks the same? Kind of.

What do you think? Do you agree with the opinion that the fragmentation held back desktop Linux? Or do you think that the multitude of choices symbolize the freedom Linux provides to the users? Share your view with us.
