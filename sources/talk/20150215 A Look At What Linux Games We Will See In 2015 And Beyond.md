A Look At What Linux Games We Will See In 2015 And Beyond
================================================================================
Linux Gaming is dead they said, Linux Gaming is pointless they said...ah whatever. Here’s a look at what’s to come for us in 2015 and beyond.

It's pretty hard to keep up with everything that's going on for us, but here's a quick look at what we could see soon.

### Confirmed Games ###

#### Adventure Games ####

- [Firewatch][1]
- [Paradise Lost: First Contact][2]
- [SteamWorld Heist][3]

#### Action Games ####

- [Darksiders][4]
- [Darksiders II][5]
- [Ray's The Dead][6]
- [Skullgirls][7]

#### FPS Games ####

- [Bioshock Infinite][8]
- Half Life 3 /troll
- [Homefront: The Revolution][9]
- [Killing Floor 2][10]
- Serious Sam 4 (No official site for it yet)
- [Storm United][11]
- [SUPERHOT][12]

#### Platformers ####

- [Broforce][13]
- [Chasm][14]
- [Giana Sisters][15]
- [Heart Forth, Alicia][16]
- [Hot Tin Roof][17]
- [Infinifactory][18]
- [Mighty No. 9][19]
- [Night in the Woods][20]

#### Strategy Games ####

- [Age of Wonders III][28]
- [Banished][29]
- [Cities: Skylines][30]
- [Clockwork Empires][31]
- [Parkitect][32]
- [Scrolls][33]
- [Space Pirates And Zombies 2][34]

#### Sandbox Games ####

- [Terraria][35]
- [X Rebirth][36]

#### Unconfirmed, but highly likely ####

- [Company of Heroes 2][37]
- [Outlast][38]
- [Shadow Warrior][39]
- [Torchlight II][40]

Then there’s the [two ports teased from Feral Interactive][41], we can’t let them be left out just because we don’t know what they are.

We imagine Aspyr Media are also working on new bigger ports, but they have only just released their latest game, so it may be a few months until we see anything.

**This isn't a complete list** of course, as we can easily forget with the sheer amount of games heading our way, and wow what a list!

We have GDC next month, and we are expecting a few announcements too. While we don't have anything solid, with Valve's big presence with Steam Machines we are expecting at least some more Linux games, otherwise it we fear it may be a little lacklustre for Valve to only show off older existing games for Linux.

What did we miss that you’re excited about for Linux?
