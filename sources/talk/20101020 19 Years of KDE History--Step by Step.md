## Introduction
KDE – one of most functional desktop environment ever. It's open source and free for use. 19 years ago, 14 october 1996 german programmer Matthias Ettrich has started a development of this beautiful environment. KDE provides the shell and many applications for everyday using. Today KDE uses the hundred thousand peoples over the world on Unix and Windows operating system. 19 years – serious age for software projects. Time to return and see how it begin.

K Desktop Environment has some new aspects: new design, good look & feel, consistency, easy to use, powerful applications for typical desktop work and special use cases. Name "KDE" is an easy word hack with "Common Desktop Environment", "K" – "Cool". The first KDE version used proprietary Trolltech's Qt framework (parent of Qt) with dual licensing: open source QPL(Q public license) and proprietary commercial license. In 2000 Trolltech released some Qt libraries under GPL; Qt 4.5 was released in LGPL 2.1. Since 2009 KDE is compiled for three products: Plasma Workspaces (Shell), KDE Applications, KDE Platform as KDE Software compilation.

## Releases
### Pre-Release – 14 October 1996

Kool Desktop Environment. Word "Kool" will be dropped in future. In the beginning, all components were released to the developer community separately without any coordinated timeframe throughout the overall project. First communication of KDE via mailing list, that was called kde@fiwi02.wiwi.uni-Tubingen.de.

### KDE 1.0 – July 12, 1998

This version received mixed reception. Many criticized the use of the Qt software framework – back then under the FreeQt license which was claimed to not be compatible with free software – and advised the use of Motif or LessTif instead. Despite that criticism, KDE was well received by many users and made its way into the first Linux distributions.
