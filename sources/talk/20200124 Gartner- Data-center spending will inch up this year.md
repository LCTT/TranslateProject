Gartner公司最新发布的数据显示全球信息技术支出可能达到3.865万亿美元,相较于2019年增幅达3.4%, 对比之下,2019年仅比2018年增长0.5%.全球信息技术支出预计将持续攀升，2021年将突破4万亿美元大关，增幅达3.7%.

Spending on hardware – including edge devices and data center hardware – will be deemphasized, while investments in software and services, including cloud, will see an increase, the firm predictsGartner公司预测，硬件支出，包括边界设备和数据中心硬件，支出所占比重将减小，与此同时，软件和服务支出，如云计算，支出所占比重将会增大.

"With the waning of global uncertainties, businesses are redoubling investments in IT as theITy anticipate revenue growth, but their spending patterns are continually shifting," said John-David Lovelock, distinguished research vice president at Gartner, in a statement“随着全球不确定性的减弱，随着IT业预期收入的增长，企业正在加倍投资IT行业。但他们的支出模式也在不断变化，“Gartner公司杰出的研究副总裁John-David Lovelock在一份声明中说道。

After a decline of 2.7% in 2019, data center systems sales will grow 1.9% in 2020, while devices – everything from laptops to printers to smartphones – will rise just 0.8% in 2020 after a 4.3% decline in 2019数据中心系统销售额在2019年仅下降2.7%之后，2020年将增长1.9%，然而从笔记本电脑到打印机到智能手机的一系列设备，销售额在2019年下降4.3%之后，2020年将仅增长0.8%

IT services will rise 5.0%, increasing its momentum over 2019, which saw a rise of 3.6%. But the real action will be in enterprise software, which is expected to grow 10.5% this year. This includes both on-premises software (such as Microsoft, Oracle) and cloud services. More of the spending growth is aimed at SaaS than on-premises software, Gartner notes.

"Almost all of the market segments with enterprise software are being driven by the adoption of software as a service (SaaS)," Lovelock said. "We even expect spending on forms of software that are not cloud to continue to grow, albeit at a slower rate. SaaS is gaining more of the new spending, although licensed-based software will still be purchased and its use expanded through 2023."Lovelock说：“几乎所有的企业软件的市场划分都受到软件服务(SaaS)的推动，我们甚至预计，在不属于云的软件形式上的支出也将继续增长，尽管增长速度较慢。SaaS正在获得更多的新支出，尽管基于许可的软件仍将被购买，其使用将扩展到2023年。

In a conference call with clients, Lovelock said there has been a shift over the last three years, where the world is going from "'we like all tech' to 'we like softer tech and not all tech.'" The trend is toward consulting, software, and the cloud, the softest of tech.在于客户的电话会议上，Lovelock说，过去三年里，世界正在经历着“‘我们喜欢所有的技术’到‘我们喜欢更软技术而不是所有的技术’的转变。”目前的趋势是咨询、软件、云计算。

The weakest segment is mobile devices. It's not that people don’t want them any longer, but in the mobile device space there is no more must-have feature, nothing to make people line up for days in advance like we saw a decade ago with each new iPhone release. "People are happy with the devices they have. The market is down to a replacement market so they extend their spending," Lovelock said.

In data center space, there's a similar pattern. Servers last longer, and at the same time, more work is being done outside the company at colocations and the cloud.

"The cloud is taking a lot [of money] out of the data center," Lovelock said. "SaaS and IaaS are all viable for organizations but taking data center dollars. Where we keep saying software is growing most quickly, that’s very true. But recognize that it is also taking money from other areas. Budgets aren’t going up, concentrations in spending is where we are seeing things happen."
