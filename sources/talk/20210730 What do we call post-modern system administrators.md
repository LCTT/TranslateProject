What do we call post-modern system administrators?
======
Our community discusses the responsibilities, possible titles, and
potential skills of today's sysadmins.
![Multi-colored and directional network computer cables][1]

For today's sysadmin, many companies expect you to have cross-platform knowledge, network knowledge, _and_ application knowledge. Add to that a dash of programming ability, a pinch of sysadmin experience, a heaping portion of social skills, and a fanatical commitment to reliability and automation.

What do we call this new, post-modern sysadmin? Do we use the same term and simply stretch the responsibilities? Or do we give this evolved role a new name?

We chatted with friends at [Enable Sysadmin][2] and in the Opensource.com Correspondent program to get their thoughts. Here's what we heard:

### Possible titles

  * How about Enterprise Architect or Solutions Architect? 
  * Or are we talking more of a DevOps Engineer or Site Reliability Engineer?
  * What level of experience and expertise are we looking at? Maybe an Applications Specialist or IT Helpdesk Administrator?
  * Overheard: Platform Engineer or System Engineer



### Potential skills

  * setting up a new user account in Google Workplace or similar
  * configuring and ordering laptop, cell phone, service contracts
  * software training (teaching a new user how to use kanban boards, shared storage solutions, or similar)
  * preparing “procedures” manuals
  * monitoring and checking security settings and storage usage
  * keeping an eye on pooled storage
  * deactivating a user leaving us
  * arranging for pickup of equipment
  * working with a user and provider having personal equipment difficulties
  * keeping an eye on internet connection services, telephone services



### Lingering questions

Does today's sysadmin need to understand clustering, containers, FS sharding, unicast/multicast coms, and other similar topics?

Is there a dividing line between infrastructure and systems?

Could the title of systems administrator remain the same while the role changes?

Does the image of a sysadmin crawling under the desk to fix broken cupholders still apply?

Are most of today's sysadmins already using a PaaS approach in tandem with doing the basic administrative tasks of managing users, accounts, applications, and licenses?

Are they also a helpful resource for colleagues, acting as an interpersonal bridge between other departments and IT?
