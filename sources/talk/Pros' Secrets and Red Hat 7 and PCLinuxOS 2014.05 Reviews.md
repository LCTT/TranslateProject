Today in Linux news Katherine Noyes scoured Linuxdom to find "Linux Pros' top command line secrets," if there's really such a thing argues one blogger. In other news, Jesse Smith reviewed new Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 Release Candidate and Jamie Watson reviewed quietly released PCLinuxOS 2014.05.

Katherine Noyes writes, "there's nothing like a little shop talk around the bar to pass the time during a quiet week, and last week afforded a dose of that as well." It was a post at the Linux Voice that got the ball rolling but one Robert Pogson is quoted as saying, "Command-line secrets? There aren't any such things." See if there's anything new [for you there][1].

**In today's** Distrowatch Weekly, Jesse Smith takes RHEL 7 Workstation RC for a test drive. Of the installer he said, "Booting from the RHEL media brought up a graphical system installer. RHEL uses the same new Anaconda installer Fedora has been using in recent releases. Personally, I feel as though the new installer is a step backward." From there was little remarkable, although that's what you want in a workstation I suppose. Smith said he wished there was a graphical package manager because users only have YUM at the commandline and there's only the standard fare in the default stack. Later GNOME shell kept crashing upon KDE login... puzzling but he quite liked the new firewall configuration. See his [full report][2] here.

**Over at** ZDNet.com, Jamie Watson reviewed recently released PCLinuxOS 2014.05. He said:

> It is an interesting concept, as you might assume from the name it includes a lot of packages, applications and drivers which are not in the standard distribution. The really interesting bit, though, is the activity-focused virtual desktop configuration. The intention is to make using PCLinuxOS easy and fun, by providing the following desktops, each with its own specific wallpaper:
> 
> Internet — browser, email, chat, IM
> Work — Office, kile, scribus
> Play — games
> Multimedia — music, video, editing and composing
> Graphics and Images — scan, edit, draw
> Administration — System management tasks

"PCLinuxOS still uses the same installer they have had for as long as I can remember, which was originally derived from the Mandriva/Mandrake installer," observed Watson. He said it ships with a modern kernel, up-to-date software, and well behaved desktops. [He concludes][3], " this new PCLinuxOS release is very nice." Additionally, [Watson testdrove][4] Ubuntu, Debian, and LMDE last week as well.
