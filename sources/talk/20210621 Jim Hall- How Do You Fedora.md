Jim Hall: 你觉得 Fedora 怎么样?
======

![][1]

我们最近采访了 Jim Hall 关于他如何使用 Fedora. 这个部分是在一个 Fedora 杂志 [系列][2] 上。 该系列介绍了Fedora用户以及他们如何使用Fedora来完成任务。 如果您对本系列的下一期采访感兴趣，请通过 [反馈表][3] 与我们联系。

## **Jim Hall 是谁?**

Jim Hall 曾担任高等教育和政府部门的首席信息管超过8年，最近创办了咨询公司 [Hallmentum][4]。 他的大部分工作包括培训、研讨会和指导帮助新的IT领导者发展领导技能，也帮助当前的IT领导者更好地发挥领导能力。除了咨询 Jim 还担任大学水平的兼职教师， 目前教授管理信息系统(MIS)和技术与专业写作课程。

Jim 是怎么长大的? Jim 童年时代的英雄来自电视和电影，包括蝙蝠侠和汉索罗。 Jim 长期以来最喜欢看的电影是《星球打字：新希望》。 Jim 说：“我是一个星球大战迷” Jim 最喜欢吃意大利菜。 “我喜欢的意大利菜可能是炖鸡”。 Jim 的观点是诚实、创造力、想象力、好奇心和开放性是一个人所能拥有的五大品质。

他喜欢写作，这很好，因为他的日常工作主要是写作。 他花了很多时间为像OpenSource.com、CloudSavvy IT 和 Linux Magazine等网站撰写“如何”文章。现在他正在写一本关于C编程的书。除了写作，他还玩电子游戏来放松。他有一台 PlayStation 4游戏机，大多数周六下午他都会坐在电视机前玩游戏。

## **Fedora 社区**

Jim 从1993年开始使用 Linux 。 他的第一个 Linux 发行版本是软著陆 Linux 系统 (SLS) 1.03， 运行 Linux 内核 0.99 补丁级别 11。 “从那以后，我一直是家里全职 Linux 用户”。 Jim became more involved in Fedora after attending a Linux conference long ago in the Fedora Core days. Jim met Tom “Spot” Callaway there, and they got talking about Fedora. “Spot encouraged me to contribute another way: by finding bugs and reporting them. And that’s how I got involved in testing for all the Beta releases”.

What would Jim like to change in Fedora? He would like to see a countdown on the getfedora.org website, that tells when the new Beta release or new full release is due out as a change in Fedora Project. And Jim wishes that other people know how easy it is to use Fedora. ”The most challenging thing in contributing to open source is to figure out how to make their first contribution.” Jim adds, “I don’t know that I’m a ‘Fedora Project member’ like other developers would be. I’m just a user. But as someone who’s been involved in developing open-source software since 1993 or 1994, I try to be a helpful member of the community. So I take every opportunity to experiment with new Fedora releases, even the Beta releases, and let people know if I find problems.”

## **What hardware do you use?**

Jim is currently running a ThinkCentre M720 Tiny. It’s configured with 8th Generation Intel Core i3-8100T (3.10GHz, 6MB Cache), 32GB (16GB + 16GB) DDR4 2666MHz, Intel graphics, 256GB Solid State Drive PCIe-NVME Opal M.2, Intel 8265 802.11AC, and Bluetooth 4.2. His monitor is an Asus VE248H. “It all works great with Fedora!” says Jim.

He uses the Perixx Periboard-512 Ergonomic Classic Split Keyboard which replaced his original Microsoft Natural Keyboard Elite PS/2 keyboard from 1998. Jim says “I sometimes swap out the Perixx keyboard for my USB clone of the original IBM Model M keyboard, from Unicomp. I do love the clicky keyboard with the buckling spring action. And mine is in the ‘putty white’ color so it has that classic look and feel.”

## **What software do you use?**

Jim is currently running Fedora 33 and previously Fedora 33 Beta, and Fedora 32. “I use GNOME 3 as my desktop. I find the defaults suit most of my needs, so I don’t have any GNOME Extensions loaded, but I do adjust a few things using Settings and GNOME Tweaks. So I’m not making any big changes. For example, I changed my default user interface font to use Droid Sans Regular. And I used Settings to change the keyboard shortcut so Alt-Tab switches windows instead of switching applications. I grew up with the Alt-Tab workflow, so I’m used to that,” says Jim. He uses Firefox and Google Chrome as his web browsers.

To run his consultancy business, Jim relies on a suite of applications:

  * [LibreOffice][5] to write his books. For example, he published [Coaching Buttons][6] last year. He wrote this book entirely using LibreOffice. More recently, he wrote a book about [Writing Free DOS Programs in C][7] and used LibreOffice for that too.
  * [INKSCAPE][8] for creating his company logo in vector format. His logo scales up and down perfectly—from a small corner image on a document to a large-format poster or banner. And INKSCAPE lets him export to a variety of common formats. Jim says that his advertising partners appreciate that INKSCAPE can export to EPS (Encapsulated Postscript), which makes it a snap to print his logo on products.
  * [GIMP][9] for other graphics, such as a splash image. “My splash image is my company logo placed over a background image, and I use that in place of a plain logo where I need extra pizzazz, such as on printed materials. I also use a version of the splash image on my website.”
  * [QEMU][10] to run a virtual machine where he can boot [FreeDOS][11]. “I like using QEMU because I can set all the options I need at the command line, which gives me a lot of extra flexibility in configuring the virtual machine. To make this easier, I put all the options into a script, and use that to run QEMU with the same options every time.”
  * [Scribus][12] to print products. Scribus is easy to use to create print-ready materials with _full bleed_, meaning any color backgrounds overlap the edge of the paper. Full bleed requires a special print-ready file that overlaps the print area . It even provides cut marks so that the printer knows exactly where to trim.
