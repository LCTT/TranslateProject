110 Fun Open Source Games and Apps
================================================================================
Once again, we're celebrating the arrival of summer with a list of some of the best open source games available. We've updated [last year's list][1] with some new arrivals, as well as getting rid of some of the older games that are no longer under active development. You'll find arcade, board, casual, puzzle, educational, first-person shooter, music, racing, role-playing, adventure, simulator and strategy games, as a well as a few apps that aren't really games but are still a lot of fun.

This year, more open source games than ever before are now available for mobile devices, primarily Android devices. Hopefully, this trend will continue in coming years.

Please note that this list is not a ranking. The apps are arranged in categories and listed alphabetically within each category.
