Everything you need to know about Grace Hopper in six books
======
A reading list for people of all ages about the legendary Queen of Code.
![Book list, favorites][1]

Grace Hopper is one of those iconic figures that really needs no introduction. During her long career in the United States Navy, she was a key figure in the early days of modern computing. If you have been involved in open source or technology in general, chances are you have already heard several anecdotes about Grace Hopper. The story of finding [the first computer bug][2], perhaps? Or maybe you have heard some of her nicknames: Queen of Code, Amazing Grace, or Grandma COBOL?

While computing has certainly changed from the days of punch cards, Grace Hopper's legacy lives on. She was posthumously awarded a Presidential Medal of Freedom, the Navy named a warship after her, and the [Grace Hopper Celebration][3] is an annual conference with an emphasis on topics that are relevant to women in computing. Suffice it to say, Grace Hopper's name is going to live on for a very long time.

Grace Hopper had a career anyone should be proud of, and she accomplished many great things. Like many historical figures who have accomplished great things, sometimes the anecdotes about her contributions start to drift towards the realm of tall tales, which does Grace Hopper a disservice. Her real accomplishments are already legendary, and there is no reason to try to turn her into the computer science version of [John Henry][4] or [Paul Bunyan][5].

To that end, here are six books that explore the life and legacy of Grace Hopper. No tall tales, just story after story of Grace Hopper, a woman who changed the world.

Broad Band: The Untold Story of the Women Who Made the Internet

### by Claire L. Evans

In [_Broad Band: The Untold Story of the Women Who Made the Internet_][8], Claire L. Evans explores the lives of several women whose contributions to technology helped to shape the internet. Starting with Ada Lovelace and moving towards modern times with Grace Hopper and others, Evans weaves an interesting narrative that highlights the roles various women played in early computing. While only part of the book focuses on Grace Hopper, the overarching narrative of Evans's work does an excellent job of showcasing Hopper's place in computing history.
