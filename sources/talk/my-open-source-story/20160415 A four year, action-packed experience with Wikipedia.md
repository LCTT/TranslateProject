A four year, action-packed experience with Wikipedia
=======================================================

I consider myself to be an Odia Wikimedian. I contribute [Odia][1] knowledge (the predominant language of the Indian state of [Odisha][2]) to many Wikimedia projects, like Wikipedia and Wikisource, by writing articles and correcting mistakes in articles. I also contribute to Hindi and English Wikipedia articles.

My love for Wikimedia started while I was reading an article about the [Bangladesh Liberation war][3] on the English Wikipedia after my 10th board exam (like, an annual exam for 10th grade students in America). By mistake I clicked on a link that took me to an India Wikipedia article, and I started reading. Something was written in Odia on the lefthand side of the article, so I clicked on that, and reached a [ଭାରତ/Bhārat][4] article on the Odia Wikipedia. I was excited to find a Wikipedia article in my native language!

A banner inviting readers to be part of the 2nd Bhubaneswar workshop on April 1, 2012 sparked my curiousity. I had never contributed to Wikipedia before, only used it for research, and I wasn't familiar with open source and the community contribution process. Plus, I was only 15 years old. I registered. There were many language enthusiasts at the workshop, and all older than me. My father encouraged me to the participate despite my fear; he has played an important role—he's not a Wikimedian, like me, but his encouragement has helped me change Odia Wikipedia and participate in community activities.

I believe that knowledge about Odia language and literature needs to improve—there are many misconceptions and knowledge gaps—so, I help organize events and workshops for Odia Wikipedia. On my accomplished list at the point, I have:

* initiated three major edit-a-thons in Odia Wikipedia: Women's Day 2015, Women's Day 2016, abd [Nabakalebara edit-a-thon 2015][5]
* initiated a photograph contest to get more [Rathyatra][6] images from all over the India
* represented Odia Wikipedia during two events by Google ([Google I/O extended][7] and Google Dev Fest)
* spoke at [Perception][8] 2015 and the first [Open Access India][9] meetup

I was just an editor to Wikipedia projects until last year, in January 2015, when I attended [Bengali Wikipedia's 10th anniversary conference][10] and [Vishnu][11], the director of the [Center for Internet and Society][12] at the time, invited me to attend the [Train the Trainer][13] Program. I was inspired to start doing outreach for Odia Wikipedia and hosting meetups for [GLAM]14] activities and training new Wikimedians. These experience taught me how to work with a community of contributors.

[Ravi][15], the director of Wikimedia India at the time, also played an important role in my journey. He trusted me and made me a part of [Wiki Loves Food][16], a public photo competition on Wikimedia Commons, and the organizing committee of [Wikiconference India 2016][17]. During Wiki Loves Food 2015, my team helped add 10,000+ CC BY-SA images on Wikimedia Commons. Ravi further solidified my commitment by sharing a lot of information with me about the Wikimedia movement, and his own journey, during [Odia Wikipedia's 13th anniversary][18].

Less than a year later, in December 2015, I became a Program Associate at the Center for Internet and Society's [Access to Knowledge program][19] (CIS-A2K). One of my proud moments was at a workshop in Puri, India where we helped bring 20 new Wikimedian editors to the Odia Wikimedia community. Now, I mentor Wikimedians during an informal meetup called [WikiTungi][20] Puri. I am working with this group to make Odia Wikiquotes a live project. I am also dedicated to bridging the gender gap in Odia Wikipedia. [Eight female editors][21] are now helping to organize meetups and workshops, and participate in the [Women's History month edit-a-thon][22].

During my brief but action-packed journey during the four years since, I have also been involved in the [Wikipedia Education Program][23], the [newsletter team][24], and two global edit-a-thons: [Art and Feminsim][25] and [Menu Challenge][26]. I look forward to the many more to come!

I would also like to thank [Sameer][27] and [Anna][28] (both previous members of the Wikipedia Education Program).
