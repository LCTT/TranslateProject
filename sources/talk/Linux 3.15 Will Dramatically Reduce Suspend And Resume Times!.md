Linux 3.15 Will Dramatically Reduce Suspend And Resume Times!
================================================================================
The upcoming Linux 3.15 kernel that is anticipated for release in mid-2014 will come with a large number of ACPI and power management updates. Thanks to the update, Linux systems will suspend and resume faster in the days to come.

Pointing out to a list of changes posted by Rafael Wysocki, an Intel employee who maintains the Linux kernel's core power management code, the report by Phoronix quotes that "visible to users with the Linux 3.15 kernel should be reduced time for system suspend and resuming, thanks to the enabling of more asynchronous threads." Linux 3.15 might also come with basic support for Nvidia's Maxwell architecture. Further details are awaited.

Meanwhile, the latest stable release of Linux was version 3.13.6. Linux founder, Linus Torvalds officially announced the sixth Release Candidate (RC) version of the upcoming Linux kernel 3.14. The RC6 is a successor to Linux 3.14-rc5. It is now available for download and testing. However, since it is a development version, it should not be installed on production machines.

"We're getting closer to the end of the rc cycle, and I have to admit that I would have wished for a less bumpy ride. There haven't been any huge problems, but there's been quite a few small bumps that shouldn't happen this late in the release cycle. And rc6 is noticeably bigger than rc5 was, as well." Torvalds said in the release note. Torvalds said that he would have wished for things to go calm by now, but there have been quite a few small issues including 'small stupid mistakes', and a few late reverts of commits. Torvalds has hinted at rc8 and rc9 if things don’t calm down. Linux 3.14-rc6 consists of a number of trivial fixes.
