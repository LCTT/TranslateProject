At 18, Patricia is a feminist with a growing list of tech achievements, open source industry experience, and her sights set on diving into her freshman year of college at Duke University's Pratt School of Engineering. She works for [Puppet Labs][2] in Portland, Oregon, as an intern, but soon she'll head to Durham, North Carolina, to start the fall semester of college.
18岁的时候，Patricia 已经是一个有多项科技成就并且拥有开源产业经验的女权主义者。紧接着，她把目光投入到在杜克大学地球科学学院工程学第一学年的学习中，以实习生的身份在位于美国奥勒冈州伯特兰市的 Puppet 实验室工作。但不久后，她又直接去了北卡罗纳州的达拉莫，开始秋季学期的大学学习。
In this exclusive interview, Patricia explains what got her interested in computer science and engineering (spoiler alert: it wasn't her father), what her high school did "right" with teaching tech, the important role feminism plays in her life, and her thoughts on the lack of diversity in technology.
在这次独家采访中，Patricia 表示，使她对计算机科学和工程学感兴趣的（剧透警告：不是她的父亲）原因，包括高中时候对科技的偏爱，女权主义在她的生活中扮演了重要角色以及对科技多样性缺乏的思考。

### What made you interested in studying computer science and engineering? ###
什么东西使你钟情于学习计算机科学和工程学？

My interest in tech really grew throughout high school. I wanted to go into biology for a while, until around my sophomore year. I had a web design internship at the Portland VA after my sophomore year. And I took an engineering class called Exploratory Ventures, which sent an ROV into the Pacific ocean late in my sophomore year, but the turning point was probably when I was named a regional winner and national runner up for the [NCWIT Aspirations in Computing][3] award halfway through my junior year.
我在科技方面的兴趣的确产生于高中时代。我曾一度想投身于生物学，直到大约大学二年级的时候。大二结束以后，我在波特兰 VA 当网页设计实习生。与此同时，我参加了一个叫做“风险勘探”的工程学课程，而在我大二学年的后期，一个水下机器人被送到太平洋。但是，转折点大概是在青年时代的中期当我因被授予“NCWIT Aspiration in Computing"奖而被称作地区和民族英雄的时候出现的。

The award made me feel validated in my interest, of course, but I think the most important part of it was getting to join a Facebook group for all the award winners. The girls who have won the award are absolutely incredible and so supportive of each other. I was definitely interested in computer science before I won the award, because of my work in XV and at the VA, but having these girls to talk to solidified my interest and has kept it really strong. Teaching XV—more on that later—my junior and senior year, also, made engineering and computer science really fun for me.
这个奖项的获得我感觉确立了自己的兴趣。当然，我认为最重要的部分是我加入到一个所有获奖者在里面的 Facebook 群聊，里面那些已经获奖的女孩们简直难以置信的相互支持。由于在 XV 和 VA
的工作，我在获奖前就已经确定了致力于计算机科学，但是和这些女孩的交谈更加坚定了这份兴趣，使之更加强壮。再后来，初高年级的时候教授 XV 也使我体会到工程学和计算机科学对我来说的确很有趣。
### What do you plan to study? And do you already know what you want to do after college? ###
你打算学习什么？毕业以后你已经知道自己想干什么了吗？

I hope to major in either Mechanical or Electrical and Computer Engineering as well as Computer Science, and minor in Women's Studies. After college, I hope to work for a company that supports or creates technology for social good, or start my own company.
我希望主修力学或电气科学以及计算机工程学和计算机科学还有女性学。毕业以后，我希望在一个支持或者创造科技为社会造福的公司工作，或者自己开公司。
### My daughter had one high school programming class—Visual Basic. She was the only girl in her class, and she ended up getting harassed and having a miserable experience. What was your experience like? ###
我的女儿在高中有一门 Visual Basic 的编程课。她是整个班上唯一的一个女生，并且以疲倦和痛苦的经历结束这门课程。你的经历是什么样的呢？
My high school began offering computer science classes my senior year, and I took Visual Basic as well! The class wasn't bad, but I was definitely one of three or four girls in the class of 20 or so students. Other computing classes seemed to have similar gender breakdowns. However, my high school was extremely small and the teacher was supportive of inclusivity in tech, so there was no harassment that I noticed. Hopefully the classes become more diverse in future years.
我的高中在高年级的时候开设计算机科学的课程，我也学习了 Visual Basic！这门课不是很糟糕，但我的确是20多个人的班级里唯一的三四个女生之一。其他的计算机课程似乎也有相似的性别比例差异。然而，我所在的高中极其小并且老师对科技非常支持和包容，所以我并没有感到厌倦。希望在未来的一些年里计算机方面的课程会变得更加多种多样。

### What did your schools do right technology-wise? And how could they have been better? ###
你的学校做了哪些促进科技的智举？它们如何变得更好？
My high school gave us consistent access to computers, and teachers occasionally assigned technology-based assignments in unrelated classes—we had to create a website for a social studies class a few times—which I think is great because it exposes everyone to tech. The robotics club was also pretty active and well-funded, but fairly small; I was not a member. One very strong component of the school's technology/engineering program is actually a student-taught engineering class called Exploratory Ventures, which is a hands-on class that tackles a new engineering or computer science problem every year. I taught it for two years with a classmate of mine, and have had students come up to me and tell me they're interested in pursuing engineering or computer science as a result of the class.
我的高中学校给了我们长时间的机会接触到计算机，老师们会突然在不相关的课程上安排科技基础任务，比如有好多次任务，我们必须建一个供社会学习课程使用的网站，我认为这很棒因为它使我们每一个人都能接触到科技。机器人俱乐部也很活跃并且资金充足，但是非常小，我不是其中的成员。学校的科技/工程学项目的一个非常强大的组成部分是一门叫做”风险勘测“的学生教学工程学课程，这是一门需要亲自动手的课程，并且每年处理一个工程学或者计算机科学难题。我和我的一个同学在这儿教授了两年，在课程结束以后，有学生上来告诉我它们对从事工程学或者计算机科学感兴趣。
However, my high school was not particularly focused on deliberately including young women in these programs, and it isn't very racially diverse. The computing-based classes and clubs were, by a vast majority, filled with white male students. This could definitely be improved on.
然而，我的高中没有特别的关注于让年轻女性加入到这些项目中来，并且在人种上也不是很多种多样。计算机课程和俱乐部大量的主要成员都是男性白人。这的确应该能有所改善。
### Growing up, how did you use technology at home? ###
在成长过程中，你如何在家使用科技？
Honestly, when I was younger I used my computer time (my dad created a tracker, which logged us off after an hour of Internet use) to play Neopets or similar games. I guess I could have tried to mess with the tracker or played on the computer without Internet use, but I just didn't. I sometimes did little science projects with my dad, and I remember once printing "Hello world" in the terminal with him a thousand times, but mostly I just played online games with my sisters and didn't get my start in computing until high school.
老实说，小的时候，我使用电脑（我的父亲设了一个跟踪装置，当我们上网一个小时就会断线）玩尼奥宠物和或者相似的游戏。我想我本可以毁坏跟踪装置或者在不连接网络的情况下玩游戏，但我没有这样做。我有时候也会和我的父亲做一些小的科学项目，我还记得我和他在电脑终端上打印初”Hello world"无数次。但是大多数时候，我都是和我的妹妹一起玩网路游戏，直到高中的时候才开始学习计算。
### You were active in the Feminism Club at your high school. What did you learn from that experience? What feminist issues are most important to you now? ###
你在高中学校的女权俱乐部很积极，从这份经历中你学到了什么？现在对你来说什么女权问题是最重要的？
My friend and I co-founded Feminism Club at our high school late in our sophomore year. We did receive lots of resistance to the club at first, and while that never entirely went away, by the time we graduated feminist ideals were absolutely a part of the school's culture. The feminist work we did at my high school was generally on a more immediate scale and focused on issues like the dress code.
在高中二年级的后期，我和我的朋友一起建立了女权俱乐部。刚开始，我们受到了很多反对和抵抗，并且这从来就没有完全消失过。到我们毕业的时候，女权主义理想已经彻底成为了学校文化的一个部分。我们在学校做的女权主义工作通常是以一些比较直接的方式和集中于像着装要求这样一些问题。
Personally, I'm very focused on intersectional feminism, which is feminism as it applies to other aspects of oppression like racism and classism. The Facebook page [Guerrilla Feminism][4] is a great example of an intersectional feminism and has done so much to educate me. I currently run the Portland branch.
就我个人来说，我更集中于交叉地带的女权主义，把女权主义运用到缓解其他方面的压迫比如种族歧视和阶级歧视。Facebook 网页《Gurrilla Feminism》是交叉地带女权主义一个非常好的例子并且我从中学到了很多。我目前管理波特兰分支。
Feminism is also important to me in terms of diversity in tech, although as an upper-class white woman with strong connections in the tech world, the problems here affect me much less than they do other people. The same goes for my involvement in intersectional feminism. Publications like [Model View Culture][5] are very inspiring to me, and I admire Shanley Kane so much for what she does.
在科技多样性方面女权主义对我也非常重要，尽管作为一名和科技世界有很强联系的上流社会女性，女权主义问题对我的影响相比其他人来说非常少，我所涉及的交叉地带女权主义也是同样的。出版集团比如《Model View Culture》非常鼓舞我，并且我很感激 Shanley Kane 所做的一切。
### What advice would you give parents who want to teach their children how to program? ###
你会给想教他们的孩子学习编程的父母什么样的建议？
Honestly, nobody ever pushed me into computer science or engineering. Like I said, for a long time I wanted to be a geneticist. I got a summer internship doing web design for the VA the summer after my sophomore year and totally changed my mind. So I don't know if I can fully answer that question.

I do think genuine interest is important, though. If my dad had sat me down in front of the computer and told me to configure a webserver when I was 12, I don't think I'd be interested in computer science. Instead, my parents gave me a lot of free reign to do what I wanted, which was mostly coding terrible little HTML sites for my Neopets. Neither of my younger sisters are interested in engineering or computer science, and my parents don't care. I'm really lucky my parents have given me and my sisters the encouragement and resources to explore our interests.

Still, I grew up saying my future career would be "like my dad's"—even when I didn't know what he did. He has a pretty cool job. Also, one time when I was in middle school, I told him that and he got a little choked up and said I wouldn't think that in high school. So I guess that motivated me a bit.

### What suggestions do you have for leaders in open source communities to help them attract and maintain a more diverse mix of contributors? ###

I'm actually not active in particular open source communities. I feel much more comfortable discussing computing with other women; I'm a member of the [NCWIT Aspirations in Computing][6] network and it's been one of the most important aspects of my continued interest in technology, as well as the Facebook group [Ladies Storm Hackathons][7].

I think this applies well to attracting and maintaining a talented and diverse mix of contributors: Safe spaces are important. I have seen the misogynistic and racist comments made in some open source communities, and subsequent dismissals when people point out the issues. I think that in maintaining a professional community there have to be strong standards on what constitutes harassment or inappropriate conduct. Of course, people can—and will—have a variety of opinions on what they should be able to express in open source communities, or any community. However, if community leaders actually want to attract and maintain diverse talent, they need to create a safe space and hold community members to high standards.

I also think that some community leaders just don't value diversity. It's really easy to argue that tech is a meritocracy, and the reason there are so few marginalized people in tech is just that they aren't interested, and that the problem comes from earlier on in the pipeline. They argue that if someone is good enough at their job, their gender or race or sexual orientation doesn't matter. That's the easy argument. But I was raised not to make excuses for mistakes. And I think the lack of diversity is a mistake, and that we should be taking responsibility for it and actively trying to make it better.
