Qualcomm loses case about its mobile-chip licensing fees
======
As 5G technology gears up, a federal court has ruled that Qualcomm’s ‘onerous’ fees for its mobile chips violate antitrust law.
Chip maker Qualcomm has lost a round in federal court over how much it charges makers of wireless devices for its mobile chips.

The company must lower its fees and submit to seven years of monitoring by the Federal Trade Commission, which brought the suit. Qualcomm says it will appeal.

For more details about the suit and its impact on upcoming 5G deployments, watch this TECH(feed) video.
