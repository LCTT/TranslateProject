[![Meet Manjaro Gaming, a Linux distro designed for gamers with the power of Manjaro][1]][1]

[Gaming on Linux][2]? Yes, that's very much possible and we have a dedicated new Linux distribution aiming for gamers.

Manjaro Gaming is a Linux distro designed for gamers with the power of Manjaro. Those who have used Manjaro Linux before, know exactly why it is a such a good news for gamers.

[Manjaro][3] is a Linux distro based on one of the most popular distro - [Arch Linux][4]. Arch Linux is widely known for its bleeding-edge nature offering a lightweight, powerful, extensively customizable and up-to-date experience. And while all those are absolutely great, the main drawback is that Arch Linux embraces the DIY (do it yourself) approach where users need to possess a certain level of technical expertise to get along with it.

Manjaro strips that requirement and makes Arch accessible to newcomers, and at the same time provides all the advanced and powerful features of Arch for the experienced users as well. In short, Manjaro is an user-friendly Linux distro that works straight out of the box.

The reasons why Manjaro makes a great and extremely suitable distro for gaming are:

  * Manjaro automatically detects computer's hardware (e.g. Graphics cards)
  * Automatically installs the necessary drivers and software (e.g. Graphics drivers)
  * Various codecs for media files playback comes pre-installed with it
  * Has dedicated repositories that deliver fully tested and stable packages



Manjaro Gaming is packed with all of Manjaro's awesomeness with the addition of various tweaks and software packages dedicated to make gaming on Linux smooth and enjoyable.
