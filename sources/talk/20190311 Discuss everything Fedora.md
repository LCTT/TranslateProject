Discuss everything Fedora
======
![](https://fedoramagazine.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/fedora-discussion-816x345.jpg)

Are you interested in how Fedora is being developed? Do you want to get involved, or see what goes into making a release? You want to check out [Fedora Discussion][1]. It is a relatively new place where members of the Fedora Community meet to discuss, ask questions, and interact. Keep reading for more information.

Note that the Fedora Discussion system is mainly aimed at contributors. If you have questions on using Fedora, check out [Ask Fedora][2] (which is being migrated in the future).

![][3]

Fedora Discussion is a forum and discussion site that uses the [Discourse open source discussion platform][4].

There are already several categories useful for Fedora users, including [Desktop][5] (covering Fedora Workstation, Fedora Silverblue, KDE, XFCE, and more) and the [Server, Cloud, and IoT][6] category . Additionally, some of the [Fedora Special Interest Groups (SIGs) have discussions as well][7]. Finally, the [Fedora Friends][8] category helps you connect with other Fedora users and Community members by providing discussions about upcoming meetups and hackfests.
