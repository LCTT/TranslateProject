7 Best Open Source Library Management Software
======

Sometimes managing a digital library gives you peace of mind as you do not need to make many efforts to maintain it. Usually, easy to organize, and can be backed up as well.

When it comes to managing the library, the library management software can make a world of difference. It can break or make your digital library management experience.

And, with open-source library management software, an organization/library can save investment costs, have better privacy, and have more flexibility without any vendor lock-ins.

So, I came up with the compilation of open-source library management software to provide you with some good options to help manage your digital library. You can use some tools for personal use-case, but many of them are geared toward public libraries.

### 1. Koha

![koha][1]

**Key** **Features of Koha:**

* An enterprise-grade library management software.
* Supports multiple languages.
* Powerful text search and enhanced catalog display.
* Built using standard library protocols to ensure interpretability between Koha and other library systems.
* Web-based UI.
* No vendor lock-in.

[Koha][2] is a well-known name when it comes to library management software, and it is considered the best of what you can get for your library. You may ask why. It handles everything like a charm, from backups and maintenance to system upgrades!

Being a truly enterprise-grade system, you’d get modules to manage circulation, cataloging, serials management, authorities, flexible reporting, label printing, and a lot more.

So, you can utilize Koha for small size to multi-branch libraries.

“It’s quite simple and straightforward” This was my initial impression while testing BiblioteQ for this list. But, don’t get fooled by its user interface.

[BiblioteQ][8] is a professional archiving, cataloging, and library management software that utilizes Qt for an eye-pleasant user interface. Furthermore, it uses PostgreSQL and SQLite for the databases.

While speaking of connectivity, it uses Open Library, SRU, and Z39.50 protocols to have a seamless experience while retrieving books and other archive options.
