5 markdown editors I recommend trying
======
Everyone has their favorite markdown editor. Here are a few I have
tried.

You can use markdown for anything—formatting websites, authoring books, and writing technical documentation are just some of its uses. I love how easy it is to create rich documents. Everyone has their favorite markdown editor. I have used several on my markdown journey. Here are five markdown editors I have considered. 

  1. [Abricotine][2] is an open source editor released under the [GPL v.3.0][3]. You can enter formatting by hand or use the menu to insert [Github flavored Markdown][4]. Abricotine allows you to preview text elements like headers, images, math, embedded videos, and to-do lists as you type. The editor is limited to exporting documents as HTML. You can use Abricotine on Linux, macOS, and Windows.

  2. [MarkText][7] is a simple markdown editor. It has many features, and it does a good job of handling documents formatted in markdown. MarkText also supports Github flavored Markdown, which allows you to add tables and blocks of code with syntax highlighting. It supports real-time preview and has a simple interface. MarkText is licensed under [MIT][8]. It supports output in HTML and PDF. MarkText is available on Linux, macOS, and Windows.

  3. [Ghostwriter][10] Is a markdown editor for Linux and Windows. According to users of its website: "Enjoy a distraction-free writing experience, including a full-screen mode and a clean interface. With markdown, you can write now and format later." It has built-in light and dark themes that come by default, or you can write your own. You can preview documents as live HTML that you can copy and paste directly into a blog or export into another format. Ghostwriter is released under the [GPL v.3.0][11].

  4. [Atom][13] is billed as a hackable text editor for the twenty-first century. It can function as a markdown editor too. It runs on Linux, Windows, and macOS and is released with an [MIT][14] license. It supports Github flavored Markdown, and **Ctrl**+**Shift**+**M** opens a preview panel so you can easily see the HTML preview. You can get started easily by creating a file and saving it with the `.md` file extension. This tells Atom that it is a markdown file. Atom automatically applies the right packages and syntax highlighting.

  5. [VSCodium][16] is the free open source code release of Microsoft's VSCode editor without the telemetry built into the stock Microsoft product. It is released with an [MIT][17] license and provides all the functionality of VSCode without the proprietary features. In addition to its other features, VSCodium can function as a markdown editor. Create a new file, click **Select a Language**, choose _Markdown_ and begin writing your code. Easily preview the text by pressing **Ctrl**-**Shift**+**V** and then toggle back to the editor. You can also easily extend the markdown editor by adding an extension. This is my favorite is [markdown editor][18] and it has an [MIT][19] license.
