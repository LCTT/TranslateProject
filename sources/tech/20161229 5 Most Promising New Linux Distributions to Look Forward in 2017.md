5 Most Promising New Linux Distributions to Look Forward in 2017
============================================================

If you visit [Distrowatch][1] regularly, you will notice that the popularity ranking barely changes from one year to another.

There are distributions that will always make it to the top ten, whereas others may be in the list today and not at the end of next year.

Another not so well-known feature of Distrowatch is a [waiting list][2] that consists of distributions:

1.  Not reviewed yet
2.  With missing or faulty components
3.  Without solid English documentation
4.  Projects that do not seem to be maintained anymore

Some of the distributions that have not been reviewed yet may be worthy of consideration due to their great potential. Keep in mind that they may never make it to the front page ranking due to lack of time or Distrowatchresources to review them.

For that reason, we will share a list of what we consider the 5 most promising new distros for 2017 and a brief review on each of them.

Since the Linux ecosystem is a live being, you can expect this article to be updated from time to time, or perhaps be radically different next year.

That said, let’s take a look!

### 1\. SemicodeOS

[SemicodeOS][3] is a Linux distribution especially built for programmers and web developers. It includes out of the box all the compilers, [text editors][4], [IDEs of the most popular programming languages][5], and collaboration tools for teams.

Even if you are not a programmer or developer but want to become one, SemicodeOS comes with the Scratch IDE to guide you in your first steps. While still in beta, this Sudan-based distribution has surely lots to offer to the community during the next year.

Check their website for more information.

### 2\. EnchantmentOS

[EnchantmentOS][7] is a Xubuntu 16.04-based distribution that includes especially-selected applications with low-memory requirements. This makes it ideal for both old and new hardware.

It follows the same Long-Term Support cycle than Xubuntu and aims at providing reliable and secure Linux software. On top of that, the built-in applications that is easy to use even for non-technical people.

In addition, its creator takes pride in that EnchantmentOS offers great performance even when booted off USB flash drives.

### 3\. Escuelas Linux

[Escuelas Linux][9] (“Linux Schools” in Spanish) is a Bodhi Linux-based distribution that is built for elementary and high school education and includes out of the box a wide variety of educational software. Regardless of its Spanish name, it provides full English support as well.

Other distinguishing features of Escuelas Linux are a lightweight desktop environment and low-memory and storage requirements. According to the official website, it can work perfectly fine with as low as 300 MB of RAM and 20 GB of available hard disk space.

### 4\. OviOS

As opposed to the previous distributions on this list, [OviOS][11] is not a multi-purpose operating system. Rather, it is described as an enterprise level storage OS that is not based on any other distribution but that is fully-compatible with the Linux Standard Base (LSB).

You can use OviOS as a robust storage appliance that can handle a iSCSI, NFS, SMB and / or FTP server. On top of this, the latest OviOS version features replication and high-availability. So what are you waiting to give it a try?

### 5\. Open Network Linux

[ONL][13] (for short) is a Debian-based distribution, and (just like OviOS) it is not a multi-purpose operating system.

If you are a network administrator you will be pleased to find out (if you didn’t know already) that you can use ONL on bare-metal switches that would otherwise require an expensive, licensed operating system.

It is important to note that ONL stands out for the wide variety of network-oriented and bare-metal related software included out of the box. Ready to give it a try?

##### Summary

You will note that all these distributions have been submitted for review during the last few months. If you like any of them, go to the [Waiting List][14] page and click the Recommend button next to the distribution name. If you do, you will be contributing towards Distrowatch assigning a resource to review it.
