Linux Release Roundup: Applications and Distros Released This Week
======

_**This is a continually updated article that lists various Linux distribution and Linux-related application releases of the week.**_

At It’s FOSS, we try to provide you with all the major happenings of the Linux and Open Source world. But it’s not always possible to cover all the news, specially the minor releases of a popular application or a distribution.

Hence, I have created this page, which I’ll be continually updating with the links and short snippets of the new releases of the current week. Eventually, I’ll remove releases older than 2 weeks from the page.

This page will be visible on It’s FOSS homepage. You can also bookmark it, if you want so that you can see what’s new in Linux world this week.

If you come across interesting new release that is not listed here, [please let me know][1] and I’ll add it.
