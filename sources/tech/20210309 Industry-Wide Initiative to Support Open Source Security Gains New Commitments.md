Industry-Wide Initiative to Support Open Source Security Gains New Commitments
======

_Open Source Security Foundation adds new members, Citi, Comcast, DevSamurai, HPE, Mirantis and Snyk_

**SAN FRANCISCO, Calif., March 9, 2021** – [OpenSSF][1], a cross-industry collaboration to secure the open source ecosystem, today announced new membership commitments to advance open source security education and best practices. New members include Citi, Comcast, DevSamurai, Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE), Mirantis, and Snyk.

Open source software (OSS) has become pervasive in data centers, consumer devices and services, representing its value among technologists and businesses alike. Because of its development process, open source has a chain of contributors and dependencies before it ultimately reaches its end users. It is important that those responsible for their user or organization’s security are able to understand and verify the security of this dependency supply chain.

“Open source software is embedded in the world’s technology infrastructure and warrants our dedication to ensuring its security,” said Kay Williams, Governing Board Chair, OpenSSF, and Supply Chain Security Lead, Azure Office of the CTO, Microsoft. “We welcome the latest OpenSSF new members and applaud their commitment to advancing supply chain security for open source software and its technology and business ecosystem.”

The OpenSSF is a cross-industry collaboration that brings together technology leaders to improve the security of OSS. Its vision is to create a future where participants in the open source ecosystem use and share high quality software, with security handled proactively, by default, and as a matter of course. Its [working groups][2] include Securing Critical Projects, Security Tooling, Identifying Security Threats, Vulnerability Disclosures, Digital Identity Attestation, and Best Practices. 

OpenSSF has more than 35 members and associate members contributing to working groups, technical initiatives and governing board and helping to advance open source security best practices. For more information on founding and new members, please visit: <https://openssf.org/about/members/>

Membership is not required to participate in the OpenSSF. For more information and to learn how to get involved, including information about participating in working groups and advisory forums, please visit <https://openssf.org/getinvolved>.

We’re honored to be part of this effort and look forward to collaborating,” said Nithya Ruff, head of Comcast Open Source Program Office.

**DevSamurai**

“We are living in an interesting era, in which new IT technologies are changing all aspects of our lives everyday. Benefits come with risks, that can’t be truer with open source software. Being a part of OpenSSF we expect to learn from and contribute to the community, together we strengthen security and eliminate risks throughout the software supply chain,” Said Tam Nguyen, head of DevSecOps at DevSamurai.

“As open source practitioners from our very founding, Mirantis has demonstrated its commitment to the values of transparency and collaboration in the open source community,” said Chase Pettet, lead product security architect, Mirantis. “As members of the OpenSSF, we recognize the need for cross-industry security stakeholders to strengthen each other. Our customers will continue to rely on open source for their safety and assurance, and we will continue to support the development of secure open solutions.”

**Snyk**

“As the number of digital transformation projects has exploded the world over, the mission of the Open Source Security Foundation has never been more critical than it is today,” said Geva Solomonovich, CTO, Global Alliances, Snyk. “Snyk is thrilled to become an official Foundation member, and we look forward to working with the entire community to together push the industry to make all digital environments safer.”

It combines the Linux Foundation’s Core Infrastructure Initiative (CII), founded in response to the 2014 Heartbleed bug, and the Open Source Security Coalition, founded by the GitHub Security Lab to build a community to support the open source security for decades to come. The OpenSSF is committed to collaboration and working both upstream and with existing communities to advance open source security for all.
