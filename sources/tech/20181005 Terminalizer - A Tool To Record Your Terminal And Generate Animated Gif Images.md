### How to Use Terminalizer

To record your session activity using Terminalizer, just run the following Terminalizer command. Once you started the recording then play around it and finally hit `CTRL+D` to exit and save the recording.

```

The recording session is started
Press CTRL+D to exit and save the recording

```

This will save your recording session as a YAML file, in this case my filename would be 2g-session-activity.yml.

Just type few commands to verify this and finally hit `CTRL+D` to exit the current capture. When you hit `CTRL+D` on the terminal and you will be getting the below output.
