Git is an indispensable part of the code-sharing development workflow. Be you a beginner or an expert, this powerful version control system is the first thing you are expected to learn when working with open source code. You don't need to know everything under the sun when it comes to Git, but knowing specific hacks makes sharing your code a lot easier on platforms like GitLab, so you can collaborate with developers far and near. If there's something you're not sure about, `git --help` can come to your rescue.

I'm amazed every day by the amount of control that knowing Git provides. There is not a single instance when you can't revert to an earlier version, however impossible or sticky the situation you may be in.
