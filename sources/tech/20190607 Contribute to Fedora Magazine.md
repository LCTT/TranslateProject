Contribute to Fedora Magazine
======

![][1]

Do you want to share a piece of Fedora news for the general public? Have a good idea for how to do something using Fedora? Do you or someone you know use Fedora in an interesting way?

We’re always looking for new contributors to write awesome, relevant content. The Magazine is run by the Fedora community — and that’s all of us. You can help too! **It’s really easy.**Read on to find out how.

### What content do we need?

Glad you asked. We often feature material for desktop users, since there are many of them out there! But that’s not all we publish. We want the Magazine to feature lots of different content for the general public.

#### Sysadmins and power users

We love to publish articles for system administrators and power users who dive under the hood. Here are some recent examples:

  * Securing connections with [stunnel][3]
  * Measuring storage performance with [dd][4]
  * Automating backups with [restic and systemd][5]



#### Developers

We don’t forget about developers, either. We want to help people use Fedora to build and make incredible things. Here are some recent articles focusing on developers:

  * Four popular [terminal multiplexers][6]
  * Making SELinux policy for containers with [udica][7]
  * Building small [container images][8]



#### Interviews, projects, and links

We also feature interviews with people using Fedora in interesting ways. We even link to other useful content about Fedora. We’ve run interviews recently with people using Fedora [to increase security][9], [administer infrastructure][10], or [give back to the community][11]. You can help here, too — it’s as simple as exchanging some email and working with our helpful staff.

### How do I get started?

It’s easy to start writing for Fedora Magazine! You just need to have decent skill in written English, since that’s the language in which we publish. Our editors can help polish your work for maximum impact.

**[Follow this easy process to get involved.][12]**

The Magazine team will guide you through getting started. The team also hangs out on [#fedora-mktg on Freenode][13]. Drop by, and we can help you get started.
