8 surprising things I learned about Python in 2021
======
Opensource.com authors shed light on new ways to use the popular
programming language.
![Hands on a keyboard with a Python book ][1]

Python has long been one of the most popular programming languages, but that doesn't mean there's nothing new to learn. This list of Opensource.com's most-read articles about Python is an excellent place to start. 

  * Widespread adoption of machine learning is here, and its applications are still growing. See how machine learning, using [Naïve Bayes][2] classifiers and implemented with Python, can solve real-life problems.

  * The transition to Python 3 is complete, but enhancements keep coming. Seth Kenlon highlights [five hidden gems in Python 3][3] that stand out among recent improvements.

  * Openshot has been one of the best options for Linux video editing for years. This popular article will show you how you, too, can [edit video on Linux][4] with this Python app. 

  * The best part of Python is the limitless possibilities a programmer can achieve. [Cython][5] is a compiler that will not only help speed up code execution but also let users write C extensions for Python.

  * Python can make API unit testing simpler. Miguel Brito shows you [three ways to test your API][6] with Python.

  * As computation power increases, more and more programs run concurrently. That can make it challenging to debug, log, and profile what's going wrong. [VizTracer][7] was created to solve exactly that problem.

  * Users' personal projects, big and small, are a good reminder of how much fun open source coding can be. Here's an inspirational one: how Opensource.com author Darin London [monitors his greenhouse][8] using CircuitPython.

  * Linux users often encounter programs requiring a lot of command-line arguments that are not pleasant to work with. This is a [nice configuration parsing hack][9] to make life easier.
