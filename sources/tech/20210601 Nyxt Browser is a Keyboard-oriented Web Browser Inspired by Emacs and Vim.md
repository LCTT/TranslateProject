Nyxt Browser is a Keyboard-oriented Web Browser Inspired by Emacs and Vim
======

You get plenty of open-source web browsers available for Linux. Not just limited to chrome-based options, but [chrome alternatives][1] as well.

Most of the options available focus on a pretty user experience while offering privacy features.

However, Nyxt browser may not be built for the best user experience in mind but something that power users love.

### Nyxt Browser: Open-Source Browser That Focuses on Keyboard Shortcuts and Commands

![][2]

[Nyxt][3] is a keyboard-oriented open-source web browser available for Linux and macOS.

Of course, not every power user utilizes keyboard shortcuts, but this aims to cater the needs of users who prefer to navigate via the keyboard.

It is inspired by how the keyboard shortcuts in Vim and Emacs work — so if you are comfortable with those editors, the shortcuts will feel familiar to you.

Unlike mainstream web browsers, you do not have to navigate your way inside multiple settings and menu, you will get all the functionality that you need to access with a quick shortcut or a command.

In case you were wondering, it is web engine agnostic, but it currently supports WebEngine and WebKit.

So, it saves time and improves your browsing experience if you are a fan of navigating around using the keyboard.

It offers a fair share of useful features which I shall highlight below.

### Features of Nyxt Browser

![][4]

You will find many non-conventional features offered here. Before exploring each of the key highlights mentioned here, you might want to go through the official documentation (press **F1** to find it) that should be linked in the welcome screen:

  * Lossless tree-based history (track the exact hierarchy of your history and easily recall what you navigated to)
  * Clipboard history to help you quickly find what you copied earlier
  * Keyboard shortcut to start entering commands (**CTRL+ Space**)
  * Navigate your way through lengthy documents using keyboard shortcuts to jump to a specific heading
  * Buffers instead of tabs which isolates behavior and settings of every tab from one another
  * Ability to close multiple tabs by mapping them with a common element
  * Mouseless navigation
  * Quickly find a buffer using search instead of looking for it among many tabs
  * Ability to run short scripts as per your workflow
  * Customizable auto-fill feature with which you can also have the current date filled in automatically in a form
  * In-built adblocker



In addition to the features highlighted above, you will get the ability to toggle a **dark mode**, **HTTPS mode**, and a ton of options from the command menu.

Moreover, it is completely customizable and programmable. So, you can choose to tailor it for yourself.

You might want to go through the [ways to install deb files][9] if you did not know.

It is available in [AUR][10] for Arch Linux users and offers packages for Alpine Linux, Nix, and Guix.

You should also find the source in the [GitHub page][11] if you need to compile it.

### Wrapping Up

While Nyxt browser may not be the most user-friendly browsing experience out there, it is certainly a special option for users who can make the most out of keyboard shortcuts and commands.

If you wanted a mouseless navigation experience, this is the browser to try. I’d suggest you to try it anyway – but if you do not generally use keyboard shortcuts to navigate, this would prove to be a complicated experience for you.
