Best Open Source LMS for Creating Online Course and e-Learning Websites
======

A Learning Management System (LMS) helps you automate and document the learning programs. It is suitable for both small-scale educational programs and university-level learning programs.

Of course, even corporate training programs can be hosted using a learning management system.

While it has a lot of use-cases, having a transparent platform for your Learning Management System should be a benefit for any organization.

So, in this article, we will be listing some of the best open source LMS.

### Top Open-Source Learning Management Systems

To ensure that you have a transparent and secure platform that comes with community and/or professional support, open-source LMS solutions should be a perfect pick.

You may self-host these software on your own [cloud servers][1] or physical servers. You can also opt for managed hosting from the developers of the LMS system themselves or their official partners.

**Note**: The list is in no particular order of ranking.

#### 1\. Moodle
