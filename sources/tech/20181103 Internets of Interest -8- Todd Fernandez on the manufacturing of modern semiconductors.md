Internets of Interest #8: Todd Fernandez on the manufacturing of modern semiconductors
======

Every since I started giving my [High Performance Go workshop][1] I’ve been fascinated with the physics of semiconductors. This presentation from Hope Conference ’09 doesn’t cover the latest EUV shenanigans, but does an excellent job of detailing the difficulties in semiconductor manufacturing _ten years ago_. The problems have only become more complicated as semiconductor fabs attempt to push feature sizes into the single digits.
