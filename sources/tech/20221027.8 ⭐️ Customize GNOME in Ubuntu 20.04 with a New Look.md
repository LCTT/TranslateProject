### Customize GNOME in Ubuntu 20.04 – New Look

##### Setup

- Install **GNOME Tweak**. If it is not installed, run below from the command line or install it from Software. We need this to configure GNOME extensions which we are going to install. 

```
sudo apt install gnome-tweak-tool
```

- Set up your browser for GNOME Extensions. You can read the detailed **guide here**, or follow the below steps.

- Visit below pages to add the extensions:

- [Chrome, Chromium, Google Chrome, Vivaldi][4]
- [Firefox][5]
- [Opera][6]

- Open terminal and install **‘chrome-gnome-shell’**

```
sudo apt install chrome-gnome-shell
```

This would configure your browser for GNOME Extensions.

- To make the above transformation, three extensions are needed. 

- [Dash to dock][7]
- [Transparent top bar][8]
- [Arc menu][9]

Visit the above pages and install the extension by clicking the “ON” button.

##### Configure

- Open the GNOME Tweak Tool.

- On the left side, click on **Extensions**.
- Click on the setup icon for Dash to Dock.
