### Zorin OS 16.1 – What’s New

Zorin OS 16.1 brings obvious up to date security patches for your system with goodies such as LibreOffice 7.3 office suites and several updated packages.

If you just bought a new Laptop or set up a new gaming workstation, Zorin OS 16.1 also comes with support for Sony’s PlayStation 5 Dual Sense game controller and Apple’s Magic Mouse 2. Plus, you get excellent support for Intel 12th Gen processors and NVIDIA RTX 3050 graphics cards.

Moreover, Zorin devs promise better support for Wi-Fi cars and printers thanks to the latest packages.

Here’s a quick summary of this minor release’s updated packages and applications.

  * Based on Ubuntu 20.04.3 LTS
  * Zorin Desktop is based on GNOME 3.38.4

  * Linux Kernel 5.13
  * GIMP 2.10.18

Full detail is available [here][3] if you care to dig deep into the changes.

So, where to download?

### Download

Before you hit download, you should know that it has a “Pro” version with additional themes and out of the box settings worth $39. And the “Core” version is completely free to download. You can read the comparison between “Pro” and “Core” on the download page.

In my opinion, the Core version should be sufficient, and if you are experienced enough, you can change the settings to make it a Pro version. So we recommend the Core version for general use.

Just so you know, if you purchase the Pro version this time (within March 17), you will be helping war-torn Ukraine as the profits foes to humanitarian aid via charities.
