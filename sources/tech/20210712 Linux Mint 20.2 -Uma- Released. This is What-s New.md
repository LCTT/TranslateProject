A new native application is introduced in the Uma release. Named “” – this desktop utility helps you to rename files and directories in batch.

Not only that, but it also brings compression settings which enable “3 times faster” transfer across devices – provided both the machine have the compression enabled.

#### Nemo 5.0

![Search in File Contents in Nemo File Manager][5]

The Cinnamon file manager Nemo version 5.0.1 brings file content search which is part of the Cinnamon 5.0 release. Today, Nemo only searches in the file and directory names for matching search criteria. With this enhancement, Nemo can search inside the file contents for a keyword. The team says that Regular expressions and recursive folder searches are also supported. This feature will be very useful for many users who use Linux Mint as a daily driver and work with many files as part of their workflow.

#### Others

It also contains support for computers with AMD/NVIDIA hybrids (i.e. systems with an integrated AMD GPU and a discrete NVIDIA GPU).”
