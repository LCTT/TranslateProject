$200 Linux Laptop Pinebook Pro is Available for Pre-order
======

_**Pinebook Pro is an inexpensive Linux laptop with modest configuration and a price tag of just $200. Pre-order for this device is open now.**_

[Pine64][1] is a popular name among the [single board computer][2] enthusiasts. It gained its fame with its $15 PINE A 64 Raspberry Pi alternative device. Since then it has formed a substantial open source community around its products.

A couple of years ago, Pine64 launched a low-end [Linux laptop][3] called [Pinebook][4]. It was basically a single board computer inside a plastic laptop body. The experimental device cost just $89.

Pine64 has now improved the specification of this inexpensive Linux laptop with the launch of Pinebook Pro.

The new Pinebook Pro is capable of playing 4K videos and performs as a decent low-end desktop computer like [Raspberry Pi 4][5]. You can see a demo in this video:

### Getting Pinebook Pro

![Pinebook Pro][6]

The Pinebook Pro costs $199.99 with additional shipping charges. Its maker Pine64 focuses mainly on the single board computers. Both Pinebook and Pinebook Pro are created simply as a community service. They claim to make no profit from it.

For this reason, there is limited supply of these devices and they get out of stock pretty soon. So if you want to buy one, request your pre-order and wait for the availability.

The pre-order is open at the moment. The Pine64 community members will get the priority and a free 128GB eMMC upgrade.

[Pre-order Pinebook Pro][8]

Pine64 warns that there could be a few dead pixels in the screen but that are characteristics of LCD screens. So do keep this in mind if you are ordering one as this won’t be counted as defect and refunds won’t be initiated.

I believe Pinebook Pro is a decent entry level Linux laptop. The pricing is great. If only they could mass produce it and make it available to a large userbase worldwide.

What do you think of Pinebook Pro? Are you going to order one for yourself?
