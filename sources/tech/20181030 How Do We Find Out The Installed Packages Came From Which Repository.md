How Do We Find Out The Installed Packages Came From Which Repository?
======
Sometimes you might want to know the installed packages came from which repository. This will helps you to troubleshoot when you are facing the package conflict issue.

Because [third party vendor repositories][1] are holding the latest version of package and sometime it will causes the issue when you are trying to install any packages due to incompatibility.

Everything is possible in Linux because you can able to install a packages on your system even though when the package is not available on your distribution.

Also, you can able to install a package with latest version when your distribution don’t have it. How?

That’s why third party repositories are came in the picture. They are allowing users to install all the available packages from their repositories.

Almost all the distributions are allowing third party repositories. Some of the distribution officially suggesting few of third party repositories which are not replacing the base packages badly like CentOS officially suggesting us to install [EPEL repository][2].

[List of Major repositories][1] and it’s details are below.

  * **`CentOS:`** [EPEL][2], [ELRepo][3], etc is [CentOS Community Approved Repositories][4].
  * **`Fedora:`** [RPMfusion repo][5] is commonly used by most of the [Fedora][6] users.
  * **`ArchLinux:`** ArchLinux community repository contains packages that have been adopted by Trusted Users from the Arch User Repository.
  * **`openSUSE:`** [Packman repo][7] offers various additional packages for openSUSE, especially but not limited to multimedia related applications and libraries that are on the openSUSE Build Service application blacklist. It’s the largest external repository of openSUSE packages.
  * **`Ubuntu:`** Personal Package Archives (PPAs) are a kind of repository. Developers create them in order to distribute their software. You can find this information on the PPA’s Launchpad page. Also, you can enable Cananical partners repositories.



### What Is Repository?

A software repository is a central place which stores the software packages for the particular application.

All the Linux distributions are maintaining their own repositories and they allow users to retrieve and install packages on their machine.

Each vendor offered a unique package management tool to manage their repositories such as search, install, update, upgrade, remove, etc.

Most of the Linux distributions comes as freeware except RHEL and SUSE. To access their repositories you need to buy a subscriptions.

### Why do we need to enable third party repositories?

In Linux, installing a package from source is not advisable as this might cause so many issues while upgrading the package or system that’s why we are advised to install a package from repo instead of source.

### How Do We Find Out The Installed Packages Came From Which Repository on RHEL/CentOS Systems?

This can be done in multiple ways. Here we will be giving you all the possible options and you can choose which one is best for you.

### Method-1: Using Yum Command

RHEL & CentOS systems are using RPM packages hence we can use the [Yum Package Manager][8] to get this information.

YUM stands for Yellowdog Updater, Modified is an open-source command-line front-end package-management utility for RPM based systems such as Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) and CentOS.

Yum is the primary tool for getting, installing, deleting, querying, and managing RPM packages from distribution repositories, as well as other third-party repositories.

```
# yum info apachetop
Loaded plugins: fastestmirror
Loading mirror speeds from cached hostfile
 * epel: epel.mirror.constant.com

 : combined logformat, although it doesn't (yet) make use of any of the extra
 : fields in combined) and generates human-parsable output in realtime.
```

The **`apachetop`** package is coming from **`epel repo`**.

### Method-2: Using Yumdb Command

Yumdb info provides information similar to yum info but additionally it provides package checksum data, type, user info (who installed the package). Since yum 3.2.26 yum has started storing additional information outside of the rpmdatabase (where user indicates it was installed by the user, and dep means it was brought in as a dependency).

```
# yumdb info lighttpd
Loaded plugins: fastestmirror
lighttpd-1.4.50-1.el7.x86_64
 checksum_data = a24d18102ed40148cfcc965310a516050ed437d728eeeefb23709486783a4d37
 checksum_type = sha256
 command_line = --enablerepo=epel install lighttpd apachetop aria2 atop axel
 from_repo = epel
 from_repo_revision = 1540756729
 from_repo_timestamp = 1540757483
 installed_by = 0
 origin_url = https://epel.mirror.constant.com/7/x86_64/Packages/l/lighttpd-1.4.50-1.el7.x86_64.rpm

 var_uuid = ce328b07-9c0a-4765-b2ad-59d96a257dc8
```

The **`lighttpd`** package is coming from **`epel repo`**.

### Method-3: Using RPM Command

[RPM command][9] stands for Red Hat Package Manager is a powerful, command line Package Management utility for Red Hat based system such as (RHEL, CentOS, Fedora, openSUSE & Mageia) distributions.

The utility allow you to install, upgrade, remove, query & verify the software on your Linux system/server. RPM files comes with .rpm extension. RPM package built with required libraries and dependency which will not conflicts other packages were installed on your system.

```

### Method-4: Using Repoquery Command

repoquery is a program for querying information from YUM repositories similarly to rpm queries.

```
# repoquery -i httpd

### How Do We Find Out The Installed Packages Came From Which Repository on Fedora System?

DNF stands for Dandified yum. We can tell DNF, the next generation of yum package manager (Fork of Yum) using hawkey/libsolv library for back-end. Aleš Kozumplík started working on DNF since Fedora 18 and its implemented/launched in Fedora 22 finally.

[Dnf command][10] is used to install, update, search & remove packages on Fedora 22 and later system. It automatically resolve dependencies and make it smooth package installation without any trouble.

```

### How Do We Find Out The Installed Packages Came From Which Repository on openSUSE System?

```
$ zypper info nano

### How Do We Find Out The Installed Packages Came From Which Repository on ArchLinux System?

[Pacman command][12] stands for package manager utility. pacman is a simple command-line utility to install, build, remove and manage Arch Linux packages. Pacman uses libalpm (Arch Linux Package Management (ALPM) library) as a back-end to perform all the actions.

```
# pacman -Ss chromium
extra/chromium 48.0.2564.116-1

```

The **`chromium`** package is coming from **`ArchLinux extra repo`**.

### How Do We Find Out The Installed Packages Came From Which Repository on Debian Based Systems?

It can be done in two ways on Debian based systems such as Ubuntu, LinuxMint, etc.,

### Method-1: Using apt-cache Command

The [apt-cache command][13] can display much of the information stored in APT’s internal database. This information is a sort of cache since it is gathered from the different sources listed in the sources.list file. This happens during the apt update operation.

```
$ apt-cache policy python3
python3:
 Installed: 3.6.3-0ubuntu2
 Candidate: 3.6.3-0ubuntu3
 Version table:
 3.6.3-0ubuntu3 500
 500 http://in.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu artful-updates/main amd64 Packages
 * 3.6.3-0ubuntu2 500
 500 http://in.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu artful/main amd64 Packages
 100 /var/lib/dpkg/status
```

The **`python3`** package is coming from **`Ubuntu updates repo`**.

### Method-2: Using apt Command

[APT command][14] stands for Advanced Packaging Tool (APT) which is replacement for apt-get, like how DNF came to picture instead of YUM. It’s feature rich command-line tools with included all the futures in one command (APT) such as apt-cache, apt-search, dpkg, apt-cdrom, apt-config, apt-key, etc..,. and several other unique features. For example we can easily install .dpkg packages through APT but we can’t do through Apt-Get similar more features are included into APT command. APT-GET replaced by APT Due to lock of futures missing in apt-get which was not solved.

```
