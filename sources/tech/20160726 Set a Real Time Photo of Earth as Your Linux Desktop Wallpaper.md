Set a Real Time Photo of Earth as Your Linux Desktop Wallpaper
=================================================================

Bored of looking at the same desktop background? Here’s something that’s (almost) out of this world. 

‘[Himawaripy][1]‘ is a small Python 3 script that fetches a near-real time picture of Earth taken by the [Japanese Himawari 8 weather satellite][2] and sets it as your desktop background.

Once installed you can set the app to run as a cron job every 10 minutes (in the background, naturally) so that it can fetch and set a realtime picture of Earth as your desktop wallpaper.

Because Himawari-8 is a geostationary satellite you’re only ever going to images of the earth as seen from above Australasia — but with real time weather patterns, cloud formations and lighting it’s still makes for spectacular scene, even if seeing things above the UK would be better for me!

Advanced settings allow you to configure the quality of the images pulled from the satellite , but keep in mind that any increase in quality will result in an increased file size, and a longer download wait!

Lastly, while this script is very similar to many others that we’ve covered over the years it is up-to-date and working.

Get Himawaripy
Himawaripy has been tested on a range of desktop environments, including Unity, LXDE, i3, MATE and a host of other desktop environments. It is free, open-source software but is not entirely straightforward to set up and configure.

Find all instructions on getting the app installed and set up (hint: there’s no one-click installer) on the project’s GitHub page.
