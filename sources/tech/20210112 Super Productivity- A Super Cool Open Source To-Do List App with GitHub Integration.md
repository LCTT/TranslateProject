Super Productivity: A Super Cool Open Source To-Do List App with GitHub Integration
======

_**Brief: Super Productivity is an awesome open-source to-do app that helps you manage tasks, track tickets, and manage time.**_

No matter what you do, improving productivity is a common goal for most of the people. Usually, you would end up trying various [to-do list apps][1] or a [note-taking app][2] to help yourself organize and remind things to efficiently keep up with your work.

Sure, you can check out those lists and try them as you like. Here, I’ve come across something unique that you also may want to try if you wanted a desktop to-do application with a solid user interface, GitHub/GitLab integration, and a list of essential features.

Super Productivity seems to be an impressive to-do list app with some unique features to offer. In this article, I’ll let you know all about it briefly.

### Super Productivity: A Simple &amp; Attractive Open-Source To-do App

![][3]

Super Productivity is an open-source app, and it is actively maintained by [Johannes Millan][4] on GitHub.

To me, the user experience matters the most, and I’m completely impressed with the UI offered by Super Productivity.

It also offers a bunch of essential features along with some interesting options. Let’s take a look at them.

### Features of Super Productivity

![][5]

  * Add to-do tasks, description
  * Track time spent on tasks and break
  * Project management (with JIRA, GitHub, and GitLab integration)
  * Ability to schedule tasks
  * Language selection option
  * Sync option to Dropbox, Google Drive, or any other WebDAV storage location
  * Import/Export functionality
  * Auto-backup functionality
  * Ability to tweak the behavior of timers and counters
  * Dark Mode them available
  * Add attachment to tasks
  * Ability to repeat tasks completely for free
  * Cross-platform support



In addition to the features I mentioned, you will find more detailed settings and tweaks to configure.

Especially, the integration with [JIRA][6], [GitHub][7] and [GitL][8][ab][8]. You can automatically assign tasks to work on without needing to check your email for the recent updates to issue trackers or tickets.

Compared to many premium to-do web services that I’ve used so far, you will be surprised to find many useful features completely for free. You can also take a look at the video below to get some idea:

### Installing Super Productivity on Linux

![][9]

You get a variety of options to install. I downloaded the AppImage file to test. But, you can also get the deb package for Debian-based distros.

It is also available as a [snap][10]. You can find all the packages in the [GitHub releases section][11].

If you’re curious, you can check out its [GitHub page][12] to know more about it.

### Concluding Thoughts

I found the user experience fantastic with Super Productivity. The features offered are incredibly useful and considering that you get some premium functionalities (that you’d get normally with to-do web services) it could be a perfect replacement for most of the users.

You can simply sync the data using Google Drive, Dropbox, or any other WebDAV storage location.

It could also replace a service like [ActivityWatch][13] to help you track the time you work on your tasks and remain idle. So, it could be your all-in-one solution for improving productivity!

Sounds exciting, right?
