Audio editor applications or digital audio workstations (DAW) were only used in the past by professionals, such as record producers, sound engineers, and musicians. But nowadays many people who are not professionals also need them. These tools are used for narration on presentations, video blogs, and even just as a hobby. This is especially true now since there are so many online platforms that facilitate everyone sharing audio works, such as music, songs, podcast, etc. This article will introduce some of the open source audio editors or DAW that you can use on Fedora Linux. You may need to install the software mentioned. If you are unfamiliar with how to add software packages in Fedora Linux, see my earlier article [Things to do after installing Fedora 34 Workstation][4]. Here is a list of a few apps for daily needs in the audio editors or DAW category.

### Audacity

I’m sure many already know Audacity. It is a popular multi-track audio editor and recorder that can be used for post-processing all types of audio. Most people use Audacity to record their voices, then do editing to make the results better. The results can be used as a podcast or a narration for a video blog. In addition, people also use Audacity to create music and songs. You can record live audio through a microphone or mixer. It also supports 32 bit sound quality.

Audacity has a lot of features that can support your audio works. It has support for plugins, and you can even write your own plugin. Audacity provides many built-in effects, such as noise reduction, amplification, compression, reverb, echo, limiter, and many more. You can try these effects while listening to the audio directly with the real-time preview feature. The built in plugin-manager lets you manage frequently used plugins and effects.

TuxGuitar is a tablature and score editor. It comes with a tablature editor, score viewer, multitrack display, time signature management, and tempo management. It includes various effects, such as bend, slide, vibrato, etc. While TuxGuitar focuses on the guitar, it allows you to write scores for other instruments. It can also serve as a basic MIDI editor. You need to have an understanding of tablature and music scoring to be able to use it.
