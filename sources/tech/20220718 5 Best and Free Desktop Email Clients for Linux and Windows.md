5 Best and Free Desktop Email Clients for Linux and Windows
======
If you are looking for free Email clients for Linux and Windows – here are 5 of them we list that you can try and consider for casual or professional uses.

Web-based email is popular today and can be accessed via browsers or mobile apps. However, in big and medium enterprises, generic users still prefer native desktop email clients for heavy and office uses. Microsoft Outlook is the most popular desktop email client, which is, of course, not free, and you have to pay a huge licence fee to use it.

There are multiple options for free desktop email clients available. Here are the best 5 free and open source email clients you can try and then deploy for your needs.

### Quick Snapshot

Here is a quick glimpse of 5 email desktop clients before you read the features and choose yourself.

### Summary

While wrapping up the best email clients for Linux, I would recommend Thunderbird for serious work and enterprise-wide deployment, if needed, along with casual users. However, you can still try other four as per your need and choice.

I purposefully did not include several below email clients in this article due to ‘not-so-good’ user feedback and some of them are ‘not free’.

* Sylpheed
* Zimbra
* Mutt
* Mailspring
* Hiri (paid)
