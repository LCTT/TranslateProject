 _The Raspberry Pi, a tiny single-board computer, has revolutionised the way in which computer science is being taught in schools. It has also turned out to be a boon for software developers. Currently, it has gained popularity much beyond its target market and is being used in robotics projects._ 

Raspberry Pi, a small development board minicomputer that runs the Linux operating system, was developed in the United Kingdom by the Raspberry Pi Foundation to promote the teaching of basic computer science in schools in the UK and in developing countries. Raspberry Pi has USB sockets, which support various peripheral plug-and-play devices like the keyboard, the mouse, the printer, etc. It contains ports like HDMI (High Definition Multimedia Interface) to provide users with video output. Its credit-card-like size makes it extremely portable and affordable. It requires just a 5V micro-USB power supply, similar to the one used to charge a mobile phone.

Over the years, the Raspberry Pi Foundation has released a few different versions of the Pi board. The first version was Raspberry Pi 1 Model B, which was followed by a simple and cheap Model A. In 2014, the Foundation released a significant and improved version of the board —Raspberry Pi 1 Model B+. In 2015, the Foundation revolutionised the design of the board by releasing a small form factor edition costing US$ 5 (about ` 323) called Raspberry Pi Zero.

In February 2016, Raspberry Pi 3 Model B was launched, which is currently the main product available. In 2017, the Foundation released the updated model of Raspberry Pi Zero named Raspberry Pi Zero W (W = wireless).

In the near future, a model that has improved technical specifications will arrive, offering a robust platform for embedded systems enthusiasts, researchers, hobbyists and engineers to use it in multi-functional ways to develop real-time applications.

**Raspberry Pi as an efficient programming device**

After getting the Pi powered up and the LXDE WM up and running, the user gets a full-fledged Linux box running a Debian based operating system, i.e., Raspbian. The Raspbian operating system comes with tons of free and open source utilities for users, covering programming, gaming, applications and even education.

The official programming language of Raspberry Pi is Python, which comes preloaded with the Raspbian operating system. The combination of Raspberry Pi and IDLE3, a Python integrated development environment, enables programmers to develop all sorts of Python based programs.

In addition to Python, various other languages are supported by Raspberry Pi. A number of IDEs (integrated development environments) that are free and open source are also available. These allow programmers, developers and application engineers to develop programs and applications on Pi.

**Best IDEs for Raspberry Pi**

As a programmer and developer, the first thing you require is an IDE, which is regarded as a comprehensive software suite that integrates the basic tools that developers and programmers require to write, compile and test their software. An IDE contains a code editor, a compiler or interpreter and a debugger, which the developer can access via a graphical user interface (GUI). One of the main aims of an IDE is to reduce the configuration necessary to piece together multiple development utilities, and provide the same set of capabilities as a cohesive unit.

An IDE’s user interface is similar to that of a word processor, for which tools in the toolbar support colour-coding, formatting of source code, error diagnostics, reporting and intelligent code completion. IDEs are designed to integrate with third-party version control libraries like GitHub or Apache Subversion. Some IDEs are dedicated to a particular programming language, allowing a feature set that matches the programming language, while some support multiple languages.

Raspberry Pi has a wide range of IDEs that provide programmers with good interfaces to develop source code, applications and system programs.

Let’s explore the top IDEs for Raspberry Pi.
