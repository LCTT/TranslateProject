BEST LINUX PHOTO MANAGEMENT SOFTWARE IN 2016
=============================================

![](http://itsfoss.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Best-Linux-Photo-Management-Software.jpg)

When it comes to Linux applications, at times there are so many choices and alternatives. But sometimes there are only a few options.

One of our readers had requested to make a list of decent **Linux photo management software**. Something that could replace now defunct Picasa on Linux.

Turns out, though not many, there are some really good applications for managing photo libraries available out there. Either you have a huge collection of photos or only a few of them, one of these options ought to suit your needs.

This list of **best photo management applications for Linux** is different from our earlier list of [best photo applications for Linux][1]. That list contained image related applications for various purposes such as editing, painting etc., while this list deals with only photo managing applications.

So, here we go. I’ve also included the installation commands of these applications for Ubuntu and its derivatives. All you need to do is open a terminal and run those.

### [GTHUMB](https://wiki.gnome.org/Apps/gthumb)

>gThumb Photo Editing

gThumb is a lightweight photo management application built mainly for GNOME desktop environment. It includes all the basic photo management features as well as some editing and advance operations. Some of the main features of gThumb are:

- Image Viewer: Supports all the major image format (including GIF) and metadata (EXIF, XMP etc).
- Image Browser: All the basic browsing operations (thumbnails, move, copy, delete etc) and bookmarking support.
- Image Organizer: Organize photos with tags, catalogs and Libraries. Importing photos from Digital Cameras. Web albums (Picasa, Flickr, Facebook etc) integration.
- Image Editor: Basic photo editing operations, filters, format conversion etc.

And there’s much more, check the official [gThumb feature][2] list. If you use GNOME or GNOME based desktop environments (like MATE) you should definitely try this one out.

#### GTHUMB INSTALLATION

```
sudo apt-get install gthumb
```


### [DIGIKAM][3]

digiKam is mainly developed for KDE, but works just as well on other desktop environments. It comes with a lot of features with an interface that works nicely. The main features of digiKam includes:

- Photo Organizer: Albums, sub-albums, tags, comments, metadata, sorting support.
- Photo Importer: Import support from Digital Cameras, USB devices, Web Albums (including Picasa & Facebook) and some other features.

digiKam is certainly one of the best Linux photo management software, if not best.

Shotwell photo manager is also for GNOME desktop environment. Shotwell, while isn’t as feature-rich as gThumb, does what it promises. The main features of Shotwell are:

- Import photos from Disks or Digital Cameras.
- Event, tags and folder based organization.
- Basic photo editing features and format conversion.

### [KPHOTOALBUM][5]

>KPhotoAlbum

KPhotoAlbum is a photo management application also intended to be used on [KDE desktop environment][6]. What makes KPhotoAlbum unique is its categorization process and time-based browsing. You can categorize photos by People, Places, Events etc. And for time-based browsing, it has a dedicated timeline or Date Bar at the bottom of the user interface.

KPhotoAlbum comes with a wide range of features for photo management and editing. Some of the main features include:

- Advance photo organization (with categories, sub-categories, tags, metadata, annotation support and much more).
- Wide range of import and export options (including almost every major photo sharing platforms).
- Various editing options (includes batch operations).

All these advanced organization features do have their downsides – user has to do most of them manually. But if you’re a KDE lover, this can be a good pick. You can use KPhotoAlbum on other desktop environments too, but it delivers the optimal experience on KDE.

#### KPHOTOALBUM INSTALLATION

```
sudo apt-get install kphotoalbum
```

### [DARKTABLE][7]

- Basic photo organization.
