What problems do people solve with strace?
======

Yesterday I [asked on Twitter about what problems people are solving with strace][1] and as usual everyone really delivered! I got 200 answers and then spent a bunch of time manually categorizing them into 9 categories of problems.

All of the problems are about either finding files a program depends on, figuring out why a program is stuck or slow, or finding out why a program is failing. These generally matched up with what I use strace for myself, but there were some things I hadn’t thought of too!

I’m not going to explain what strace is in this post but I have a [free zine about it][2] and [a talk][3] and [lots of blog posts][4].

### problem 1: where’s the config file?

The #1 most popular problem was “this program has a configuration file and I don’t know where it is”. This is probably my most common use for strace too, because it’s such a simple question.

This is great because there are a million ways for a program to document where its config file is (in a man page, on its website, in `--help`, etc), but there’s only one way for it to actually open it (with a system call!)

### problem 2: what other files does this program depend on?

You can also use strace to find other types of files a program depends on, like:

  * dynamically linked libraries (“why is my program loading the wrong version of this `.so` file?“) like [this ruby problem I debugged in 2014][5]
  * where it’s looking for its Ruby gems (Ruby specifically came up a few times!)
  * SSL root certificates
  * a game’s save files
  * a closed-source program’s data files
  * [which node_modules files aren’t being used][6]



### problem 3: why is this program hanging?

You have a program, it’s just sitting there doing nothing, what’s going on? This one is especially easy to answer because a lot of the time you just need to run `strace -p PID` and look at what system call is currently running. You don’t even have to look through hundreds of lines of output!

The answer is usually ‘waiting for some kind of I/O’. Some possible answers for “why is this stuck” (though there are a lot more!):

  * it’s polling forever on a `select()`
  * it’s `wait()`ing for a subprocess to finish
  * it’s making a network request to something that isn’t responding
  * it’s doing `write()` but it’s blocked because the buffer is full
  * it’s doing a `read()` on stdin and it’s waiting for input



Someone also gave a nice example of using strace to debug a stuck `df`: ‘with strace df -h you can find the stuck mount and unmount it”.

### problem 4: is this program stuck?

A variation on the previous one: sometimes a program has been running for longer than you expected, and you just want to know if it’s stuck or of it’s still making progress.

As long as the program makes system calls while it’s running, this is super easy to answer with strace – just strace it and see if it’s making new system calls!

### problem 5: why is this program slow?

You can use strace as a sort of coarse profiling tool – `strace -t` will show the timestamp of each system call, so you can look for big gaps and find the culprit.

Here are 9 short stories from Twitter of people using strace to debug “why is this program slow?”.

  * Back in 2000, a Java-based web site that I helped support was dying under modest load: pages loaded slowly, if at all. We straced the J2EE application server and found that it was reading class files one. byte. at. a. time. Devs weren’t using BufferedReader, classic Java mistake.
  * Optimizing app startup times… running strace can be an eye-opening experience, in terms of the amount of unnecessary file system interaction going on (e.g. open/read/close on the same config file over and over again; loading gobs of font files over a slow NFS mount, etc)
  * Asked myself why reading from session files in PHP (usually &lt;100 bytes) was incredibly slow. Turned out some `flock`-syscalls took ~60s
  * A program was behaving abnormally slow. Used strace to figure out it was re-initializing its internal pseudo-random number generator on every request by reading from /dev/random and exhausting entropy
  * Last thing I remember was attaching to a job worker and seeing just how many network calls it was making (which was unexpected).
  * Why is this program so slow to start? strace shows it opening/reading the same config file thousands of times.
  * Server using 100% CPU time randomly with low actual traffic. Turns out it’s hitting the number of open files limit accepting a socket, and retrying forever after getting EMFILE and not reporting it.
  * A workflow was running super slow but no logs, ends up it was trying to do a post request that was taking 30s before timing out and then retrying 5 times… ends up the backend service was overwhelmed but also had no visibility
  * using strace to notice that gethostbyname() is taking a long time to return (you can’t see the `gethostbyname` directly but you can see the DNS packets in strace)



### problem 6: hidden permissions errors

Sometimes a program is failing for a mysterious reason, but the problem is just that there’s some file that it doesn’t have permission to open. In an ideal world programs would report those errors (“Error opening file /dev/whatever: permission denied”), but of course the world is not perfect, so strace can really help with this!

This is actually the most recent thing I used strace for: I was using an AxiDraw pen plotter and it printed out an inscrutable error message when I tried to start it. I `strace`d it and it turned out that my user just didn’t have permission to open the USB device.

### problem 7: what command line arguments are being used?

Sometimes a script is running another program, and you want to know what command line flags it’s passing!

A couple of examples from Twitter:

  * find what compiler flags are actually being used to build some code
  * a command was failing due to having too long a command line



### problem 8: why is this network connection failing?

Basically the goal here is just to find which domain / IP address the network connection is being made to. You can look at the DNS request to find the domain or the `connect` system call to find the IP.

In general there are a lot of stories about using strace to debug network issues when `tcpdump` isn’t available for some reason or just because it’s what the person is more familiar with.

### problem 9: why does this program succeed when run one way and fail when run in another way?

For example:

  * the same binary works on one machine, fails on another machine
  * works when you run it, fails when spawned by a systemd unit file
  * works when you run it, fails when you run it as “su - user /some/script”
  * works when you run it, fails when run as a cron job



Being able to compare the strace output in both cases is very helpful. Though my first step when debugging “this works as my user and fails when run in a different way on the same computer” would be “look at my environment variables”.

### what I’m doing with this: slowly building some challenges

The reason I’m thinking about this is that I’ve been slowly working on some challenges to help people practice using strace and other command line tools. The idea is that you’re given a problem to solve, a terminal, and you’re free to solve it in any way you want.

So my goal is to use this to build some practice problems that you can solve with strace that reflect the kinds of problems that people actually use it for in real life.

### that’s all!

There are probably more problems that can be solved with strace that I haven’t covered here – I’d love to hear what I’ve missed!

I really loved seeing how many of the same uses came up over and over and over again – at least 20 different people replied saying that they use strace to find config files. And as always I think it’s really delightful how such a simple tool (“trace system calls!”) can be used to solve so many different kinds of problems.
