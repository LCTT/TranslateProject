A handy KDE Plasma Tip!

If you have a mouse with additional buttons, you can assign buttons for desktop tasks like Application Launcher, Switch Desktop etc.

For this, right-click on the desktop and select “Configure Desktop and Wallpaper”. Now, go to Mouse Actions.

Here, click on the “Add Action” button and inside the “Input Here” button, click the key on your mouse that you want to use.

Now, select the desired action from the dropdown menu and click “Apply”.
