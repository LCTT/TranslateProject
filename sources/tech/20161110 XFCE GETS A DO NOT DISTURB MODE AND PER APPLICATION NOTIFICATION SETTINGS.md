[XFCE GETS A `DO NOT DISTURB` MODE AND PER APPLICATION NOTIFICATION SETTINGS][7]
============================================================

The Xfce developers are busy [porting][3] Xfce applications and components to GTK3, and in the process, they are also adding new features.

**"Do not disturb"**, a much requested feature, landed in _xfce4-notifyd_ 0.3.4 (the Xfce notification daemon) [recently][4]. Using this, you can suppress notification bubbles for a limited time-frame.

Furthermore, **the latest _xfce4-notifyd_ includes an option to enable or disable notifications on a per-application basis**.

After an application sends a notification, the app is added to a list in the notification settings. From here, you can control which applications can show notifications.

Both the "Do not disturb" mode and the application-specific notification settings can be found in _Settings > Notifications_:

][5]

Right now there's no way of accessing notifications missed due to the "Do not disturb" mode being enabled. However, **a notification logging / persistence feature is expected in a future release.**

And finally, yet** another feature** in _xfce4-notifyd_ 0.3.4 is an **option display notifications on the primary monitor** (until now, notifications were displayed on the active monitor).This option is not available in the GUI for now, and it must be enabled using Xfconf (Settings Editor), by adding a Boolean property, called "/primary-monitor" (without the quotes), to _xfce4-notifyd_ and set it to "True":

**_xfce4-notifyd_ 0.3.4 is not available in a PPA right now, but it will probably be added to the [Xfce GTK3 PPA][1] soon.**

**If you want to build it from source, download it from [HERE][2].**
