Looking for Adobe alternatives as a Linux user? You’re not alone. If you’re an avid graphic designer, you’re probably well-versed at avoiding pricey Adobe products. Still, Linux users are typically the ones granted the shortest end of the stick when it comes to Adobe. Adobe alternatives are a must – but what exactly are the best options available?

It ultimately comes down to the specific Adobe program and what you hope to accomplish. Fortunately, as necessity remains the mother of all invention, others have answered the call. The result is a series of highly efficient stand-ins for Adobe software.

### Evince (Adobe Acrobat)

![Evince_AdobeReaderSubstitute](https://www.maketecheasier.com/assets/uploads/2016/08/Evince_AdobeReaderSubstitute.jpg "Evince_AdobeReaderSubstitute")

Like Adobe Acrobat Reader, [Evince][6] is a “document viewer for multiple documents.” For example, users may rely on Evince as a PDF viewer. It also supports various comic book formats (cbr, cbz, cb7, and cbt). You can find a [complete list of supported formats][7] at the Evince website.

Linux users don’t have to look high and low for Evince, as it comes standard. You can head to the official site for updates when needed.

### Pixlr (Adobe Photoshop)

The wonderful thing about [Pixlr][8] is this Adobe alternative’s various tools are available online. If you have an Internet connection, then you have a powerful image editing workspace.

[Pixlr Editor][9] is a capable stand-in for Photoshop, as you can work with layers and related effects. It also has some nifty drawing and color-editing tools. [Pixlr Express][10] doesn’t have as many features, as it’s mainly for enhancing images. Adjust the color and clarity, and also add some Instagram-friendly effects!

It’s incredible what you can accomplish with Pixlr, and it’s completely free.

### Inkscape (Adobe Illustrator)

[Inkscape][11] is another well-recommended free Adobe alternative. It functions mainly as a “professional vector graphics editor.” In addition to Illustrator, Inkscape also gets held up against Corel Draw, Freehand, and Xara X.

Its vector design tools are handy for crafting logos and “high scalability” artwork. Inkscape includes drawing, shape, and text tools. Layer tools allow you to lock, group, or hide individual layers.

### Pinegrow Web Editor (Adobe Dreamweaver)

![Pinegrow_Dreamweaversubstitute](https://www.maketecheasier.com/assets/uploads/2016/08/Pinegrow_Dreamweaversubstitute-400x204.jpg "Pinegrow_Dreamweaversubstitute")

[Pinegrow Web Editor][12] is a great substitute for Dreamweaver on Linux. The program lets you work on HTML sites right on your desktop.

Instead of just creating with code (and having to preview later), Pinegrow provides a detailed visual editing experience. You can see and test your HTML projects live, learning in real time whether links work or if images are where they’re supposed to be. Pinegrow also comes with a WordPress theme builder.

Try it free for 30 days. If you like it, you can buy it for a one-time payment of $49.

### Scribus (Adobe InDesign)

![Scribus_InDesignsubstitute](https://www.maketecheasier.com/assets/uploads/2016/08/Scribus_InDesignsubstitute.jpg "Scribus_InDesignsubstitute")

[Scribus][13] is probably the closest substitute you’ll find to Adobe’s InDesign. According to its developers, you should [strongly consider][14] Scribus because “it’s reliable and free.”

In actuality, Scribus is more than an excellent desktop publishing tool; it’s a great  _self-_ publishing tool. Why rely on expensive businesses to create high-quality magazines and books when you can do it yourself?  Scribus currently allows designers to work with a 200-color palette, with [promises to double the number][15] of colors with the next stable version.

### digiKam (Adobe Lightroom)

![digiKam_Lightroomsubstitute](https://www.maketecheasier.com/assets/uploads/2016/08/digiKam_Lightroomsubstitute-400x213.jpg "digiKam_Lightroomsubstitute")

[digiKam][16] is perhaps the best Lightroom alternative at the moment for Linux users. Features include the capacity to import photographs, organize image collections, enhance images, create slideshows, and more.

Its sleek design and advanced features are an actual labor of love; the people behind digiKam are, in fact, photographers. More than that, they wanted the ability to do in Linux what others can accomplish with Lightroom.

### Webflow (Adobe Muse)

![Webflow_Museubstitute](https://www.maketecheasier.com/assets/uploads/2016/08/Webflow_Museubstitute-400x158.jpg "Webflow_Museubstitute")

[Webflow][17] is yet another website that proves how much you can accomplish without having to download software. A very handy Adobe alternative for Muse, Webflow is ideal for creating highly-responsive website designs.

One of the best aspects of Webflow is that you don’t need to do your own coding. Just drag and drop images and write text. Webflow does the “heavy lifting” for you. There’s the option of building a website completely from scratch, or you can use various templates. Although free, the premium options boast additional features, such as the ability to easily export HTML and CSS to use elsewhere.

### Tupi (Adobe Animate)

![Tupi_Animatesubstitute](https://www.maketecheasier.com/assets/uploads/2016/08/Tupi_Animatesubstitute.jpg "Tupi_Animatesubstitute")

[Tupi][18] is an Adobe alternative for Animate – or anyone who isn’t [too keen on Flash][19] these days. Sure, Tupi’s creators state that it’s not meant to be competition for Flash. However, the ability to work with HTML5 doesn’t stop it from being an ideal substitute.

Draw and animate in 2D on your PC or tablet. Unsure how to get started? Learn how to make cutout animations and more using the site’s [YouTube tutorials][20].

### Black Magic Fusion (Adobe After Effects)

![Fusion_AFterEffectssubstitute](https://www.maketecheasier.com/assets/uploads/2016/08/Fusion_AFterEffectssubstitute.jpg "Fusion_AFterEffectssubstitute")

[Black Magic Fusion][21] was destined to upstage Adobe’s After Effects. This visual effects software is the outcome of roughly 25 years of development! Fusion is routinely used to create impressive effects in Hollywood movies and television shows – driving home its detailed and stylish capabilities.

Fusion works by using nodes, “small icons that represent effects, filters, and other processing .” These nodes are linked together to create a series of sophisticated visual effects. The program includes a host of features such as image retouching, object tracking, and mind-blowing 3D effects.

You have the option of a free version or shelling out $995 for Fusion Studio. To help you decide, [you can compare][22]free and premium Fusion features.
