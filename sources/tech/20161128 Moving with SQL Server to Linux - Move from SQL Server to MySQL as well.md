Over the recent years, there has been a large number of individuals as well as organizations who are ditching the Windows platform for Linux platform, and this number will continue to grow as more developments in Linux are experienced. Linux has for long been the leader in Web servers as most of the web servers run on Linux, and this could be one of the reasons why the high migration is being experienced.

The reasons for this migration are as numerous, ranging from more platform stability, reliability, costs, ownership and security among others. As more entities migrate to the Linux platform, so is the migration from MS SQL server database management system, top MySQL, because of interoperability and platform independence of MySQL, as well as low acquisition costs.

As much as the migration is to be done, the need for it should be necessitated by the business and not just for the mere pleasure of it.As such, a comprehensive feasibility and cost-benefit analysis should be carried out to know the impact that the migration will have on your business, both positive and negative.

The migration may be based on the following key factors:

### To have Control Over the Platform

Unlike in windows where you are not in full control of the releases and fixes, Linux does give you that flexibility to get fixes as and when you require them. This is preferred by developers and security personnel in that they are able to immediately apply a fix when a security threat is identified, unlike in Windows where you can only hope they release the fixes soon.

### Joining the Crowd

The Linux platform far outnumbers Windows in the number of servers that are running on it, nearly a quarter of all servers in the world, and the trend is not about to change anytime soon. Many organizations, therefore, do migrate so as to be fully on Linux rather than running two platforms concurrently, which adds up to their operating costs.

### Microsoft isn’t Open Sourcing SQL Server’s Code

In as much as Microsoft have announced that their next release of MSSQL server (named Denali) will be a Linux version, that will still not open their source code, meaning that their licenses will still apply, but the release will be run on Linux. This still locks out the many users who would happily take to the release if it was open source.

This still does not give an alternative to those users who are using Oracle, which is not open source; neither does it to those [using MySQL][7], which is fully open source.

### Saving on License Costs

The cost implication of licenses is a huge letdown for many users. Running a MSSQL server on Windows platform has too many licenses involved. You need licenses for:

*   The windows operating system
*   The MSSQL server
*   Specific database tools e.g. SQL analytics tools, etc.

Unlike in Windows platform, Linux eliminates the issues of high licenses costs, and thus more appealing to users. MySQL database is also a free source even though it offers the flexibility just as MSSQL server, thus it is more preferred. Most of the database utility tools for MySQL are mostly free, unlike for MSSQL.

### Sometimes, the Specific Hardware being Used

Because Linux is developed and always being enhanced by various developers, it is independent of the hardware it operates on and thus widely used on different hardware platforms. However, as much as Microsoft has tried to ensure that Windows and MSSQL server are hardware independent; there are still some limitations in platform independence.

### Support

With Linux and MySQL, as well as with other open source software, it is easier to get support on the specific need that you have, because there are various developers involved in their development. These developers maybe within your locality, thus are easily reached. Also, online forums are of great help whereby you are able to post and discuss the issues you face.

For commercial software, you get support based on their software agreement with you and their timing, and at times may not give you a solution within the timelines that you have.

In every case, migrating to Linux gives you the best option and outcome that you can have, by joining a radical, stable and reliable platform, which is known to be more robust than Windows. It is worth a shot.
