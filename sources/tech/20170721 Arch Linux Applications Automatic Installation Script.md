Arch Linux Applications Automatic Installation Script
======

![](https://www.ostechnix.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/ArchI0-Arch-Linux-Applications-Automatic-Installation-Script-720x340.png)

Howdy Archers! Today, I have stumbled upon an useful utility called **“ArchI0”** , a CLI menu-based Arch Linux applications automatic installation script. This script provides an easiest way to install all essential applications for your Arch-based distribution. Please note that **this script is meant for noobs only**. Intermediate and advanced users can easily figure out [**how to use pacman**][1] to get things done. If you want to learn how Arch Linux works, I suggest you to manually install all software one by one. For those who are still noobs and wanted an easy and quick way to install all essential applications for their Arch-based systems, make use of this script.

### ArchI0 – Arch Linux Applications Automatic Installation Script

The developer of this script has created two scripts namely **ArchI0live** and **ArchI0**. You can use ArchI0live script to test without installing it. This might be helpful to know what actually is in this script before installing it on your system.

### Install ArchI0

To install this script, Git cone the ArchI0 script repository using command:
```
$ git clone https://github.com/SifoHamlaoui/ArchI0.git

```

The above command will clone the ArchI0 GtiHub repository contents in a folder called ArchI0 in your current directory. Go to the directory using command:
```
$ cd ArchI0/

```

Make the script executable using command:
```
$ chmod +x ArchI0live.sh

```

Run the script with command:
```
$ sudo ./ArchI0live.sh

```

We need to run this script as root or sudo user, because installing applications requires root privileges.

> **Note:** For those wondering what all are those commands for at the beginning of the script, the first command downloads **figlet** , because the script logo is shown using figlet. The 2nd command install **Leafpad** which is used to open and read the license file. The 3rd command install **wget** to download files from sourceforge. The 4th and 5th commands are to download and open the License File on leafpad. And, the final and 6th command is used to close the license file after reading it.

Type your Arch Linux system’s architecture and hit ENTER key. When it asks to install the script, type y and hit ENTER.

Once it is installed, you will be redirected to the main menu.

As you see in the above screenshot, ArchI0 has 13 categories and contains 90 easy-to-install programs under those categories. These 90 programs are just enough to setup a full-fledged Arch Linux desktop to perform day-to-day activities. To know about this script, type **a** and to exit this script type **q**.

After installing it, you don’t need to run the ArchI0live script. You can directly launch it using the following command:
```
$ sudo ArchI0

```

It will ask you each time to choose your Arch Linux distribution architecture.
