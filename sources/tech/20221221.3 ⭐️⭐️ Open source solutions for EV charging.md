Open source solutions for EV charging
======
电动汽车充电开源解决方案
======

Maybe you hate pumping gas in the cold (or heat), or you care about the environment. Maybe the latest gas prices and general inflation has you thinking more about stretching your money. Perhaps you simply think electric vehicles (EVs) look cool. No matter the reason, you're excited about your next vehicle being an EV and you're not alone! The EV market share is set to [expand to 30% by 2040][1]. The [US government provides a handy comparison tool][2] to show that the cost of ownership of an EV easily beats owning and operating fossil fuel vehicles. Despite this, EV charging costs can still hit you hard in your wallet.

也许你讨厌在寒冷或者酷热的时候加油，或者你关心环境问题。也想要最新的汽油价格和通货膨胀让你更多考虑挣钱的问题。也许你只是认为电动汽车看起来很酷。不管什么原因，你会因为你的下一辆汽车是电动汽车感到激动，而且你并不孤独。电动汽车的市场份额将在 [2040 年扩展到 30%][1] 。[美国政府提供了一个方便的比较工具][2]，用来展示拥有一辆电动汽车的维护成本比化石燃料汽车的少很多。尽管如此，电动汽车充电的费用仍然会给你的钱包带来沉重的负担。

One of the most elegant ways to solve cost problems in general is to apply open source principles to accelerate innovation. Fortunately for you, this has been done in the EV charging area to find a way to get low-cost electricity and low-cost chargers.

一般来说解决成本问题最优雅的方式之一是应用开源原则来加速创新。幸运的是，在电动汽车充电领域已经找到了一种获得低成本电力和低成本充电桩的方法。

To control the costs of EV charging, first you need low-cost electricity. In the old days, that would mean going from oil to coal, which is not a step up. Today, as it turns out, [solar photovoltaic (PV)][3] devices that convert sunlight directly into electricity normally provide the lowest-cost electricity. Coal companies are going bankrupt because they can no longer compete with clean solar power. This is also why [solar power is seeing explosive growth all over the world][4]. Many homeowners are putting [solar panels on their roofs][5] or on ground mounts in the backyard to cover all of their home’s electric needs. But how can you charge your EV with solar energy if you have limited roof area or a small backyard?

为了控制电动汽车充电的成本，首先，你需要低成本的电力。再过去，这意味着从石油到煤炭,这不是进步。如今，事实证明，通常能将太阳能直接转化为电能的 <ruby>[光伏发电][3]<rt>solar photovolataic (PV)</rt></ruby> 设备可以提供最低成本的电力。煤炭公司正在破产，因为他们无法继续与清洁的太阳能竞争。这也是为什么[太阳能发电在世界各地都爆炸性增长][4]的原因。许多房主把[太阳能电池板放到他们的房顶][5]或者后院的支架上，以满足他们家庭的电力需求。但是，如果你的屋顶面积有限或者后院很小，你怎样才能用太能能给你的电动汽车充电呢？

### Open source PV parking canopy

### 开源光伏停车棚

One approach that major corporations are taking is to make a PV canopy over their parking lots. If you want to do this yourself, a new [study][6] provides a full mechanical and economic analysis of three novel open source PV canopy systems:

大型企业正在采取的一个方法是在他们的停车场上建造一个光伏顶棚。如果你自己想做一个，一个新的[研究][6]对三种新型开源光伏顶棚系统做了全面的机械和经济方面的分析。

- Use an exclusively wood, single-parking-spot spanning system
- Use a wood and aluminum double-parking-spot spanning system
- Use a wood and aluminum cantilevered system  
- 使用专用木制单一停车位横跨系统
- 使用木材和铝制双停车位横跨系统
- 使用木材和铝制悬臂系统

The designs are presented as 5-by-6 stall builds, but all three systems are scalable to any amount of parking spots required. This includes a 1-stall 6kW system to charge a single car at home (as shown below). All of the racks are rated for a 25-year expected lifetime to match the standard PV warranty.

这些设计是以 5 * 6 个停车位的样式呈现的，但是着三个系统都可以扩展到任何需要的停车位数量。包括一个 6kW 的家用单车充电系统（如下图）。所有的架子都有25年的预期寿命来配合标准的光伏保修。

The open source PV canopies are all designed to withstand a brutal Canadian winter. They also follow Canada’s strict building codes. So if you live anywhere else, the system as designed should still work for you. The complete [designs][8]and bill of materials of the canopies are provided, along with basic instructions. They are released with an open source license that enables anyone to fabricate them following the spirit of the free book about DIY solar power collectors [_To Catch the Sun_][9].

这写开源光伏顶棚都是为了抵御加拿大残酷的冬天而设计的，它们遵循加拿大严格的建筑规范。所以，不管你住在其他任何地方，这个设计都可以正常工作。顶棚的[完整设计][8]以及材料清单，包括基本说明都有提供。它们以开放源码许可的方式发布，保证任何人都可以依照免费的关于 DIY 太阳能收集器的书籍 <ruby>[《拥抱太阳》][9]<rt>_To Catch the Sun_</rt></ruby>制作它。

The results of the previously mentioned [study][6] show that open source designs are much less expensive than proprietary products. Single-span systems provide cost savings of 82-85%, double-span systems save 43-50%, and cantilevered systems save 31-40%.

前面提到的[研究][6]结果显示，开源设计比专利产品的成本低很多。单跨系统可节省成本 82% 到 85%，双跨系统节省成本 43% 到 50%，悬臂系统节省 31% 到 40% 。

Most importantly, the designs give you more than enough energy (if you have a normal commute) to cover your charging needs. In the first year of operation, PV canopies can provide 157% of the energy needed to charge the least efficient EV currently on the market.

最重要的是，这些设计给你提供了足够多的能源（如果你只是正常通勤）来满足你的充电需求。在运行的第一年，光伏顶棚可以提供目前市场上效率最低的电动汽车充电需求的 157% 。

### Open source EV chargers

### 开源电动汽车充电桩

Another way to cut the cost of EV ownership is to install an open source EV charger. [OpenEVSE][11] is an Arduino-based charging station composed of [open source software][12] and hardware which can be made DIY-style. They are small, lightweight, and portable, so you can use them at home or on the road.

减少电动车维护成本的另一个办法是安装一个开源的电动车充电桩。[OpenEVSE][11] 是一个基于 Arduino 的充电桩，由[开源软件][12]和硬件组成，可以以 DIY 的方式制作。

OpenEVSE powers charging stations for many EV manufacturers all over the world. You can adapt it to fit your requirements. OpenEVSE is now quite mature and supports advanced features including adjustable current, temperature monitoring, and a real-time power display. You can buy the hardware pre-assembled and ready to go. If you want to save more money (and have more fun) buy a kit and build it yourself.

OpenEVSE 充电桩兼容世界上所有的电动汽车厂商。你可以根据自己的需求调整它。OpenEVSE 已经相当成熟，支持许多先进的功能，包括可调电流，温度检测和试试功率显示。你可以购买预先组装好的硬件马上体验。如果你想节省更多的钱（体验更多的乐趣），可以购买一套套件自己动手制作。

I hope to see more designs of EV power solutions in the future. Keep your eyes open, roll up your sleeves for some DIY, and enjoy assembling your open source, solar-powered EV charging solutions!
