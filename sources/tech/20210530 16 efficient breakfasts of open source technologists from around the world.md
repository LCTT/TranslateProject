16 efficient breakfasts of open source technologists from around the world
======
Cheese from Bavaria, a Brazilian breakfast sandwich, a New York bagel,
or a hot cup of tea from Great Britain. Our contributors share their
favorite way to fuel their day.

Breakfast …. It's the most important meal of the day, or so they say. But who wants to spend time on a big meal when you could be sleeping instead? (And if your breakfast is _too_ big, you might feel the need to go back to sleep.)

Still, busy developers, sysadmins, and other IT pros need some fuel to start their day. So, we asked some of our contributors to tell us how they feed their hunger without "eating" into their rest or work time. Here's what they had to say.

Bacon, egg, and cheese on a bagel. As NYC as it gets. —[Emily Brand][2]

An Indian Spicy Chai followed by oats and cream. —[Kedar Vijay Kulkarni][3]

I start in on coffee before I get in the shower, and that's pretty much all I consume until lunch. I usually go through about 24–32oz. of coffee in a typical morning, although since I got an Ember travel mug, I'm not "warming up" as often as I was with regular mugs. The only exception is Sunday, when I have a reward mini coffee cake with breakfast for taking my one weekly injectable medication. —[Kevin Sonney][4]

My go-to is peanut butter on two slices of wheat, sunflower, or whole-grain toast with a cup of tart cherry or organic grape juice. —[Don Watkins][5]

A cup of hot-brewed coffee and scrambled eggs is my go-to breakfast ritual. —[Sudeshna Sur][6]

This is the best breakfast... —[Chris Hermansen][7]

I'm an oatmeal guy for the most part. Walnuts, brown sugar, cinnamon, and flaxseeds for the win. Something I learned from being a runner is, if you fuel up, you can forget about food for a good long time. —[Steve Morris][10]

Coffee-latte + whole wheat bread with cream and grape jelly. Usually, I do a more traditional Brazilian breakfast of coffee + French bread with ham and cheese. —[Igor Steinmacher][11]

Scrambled eggs, chicken sausage, and cooked apples. —[Petra Sargent][12]

300ml of cold-brew coffee (not because I'm fancy, but because I can make it once a week and save time for more important matters, like writing to a mailing list about my breakfast habits) mixed with 240ml unsweetened hemp milk, one umeboshi, and a fistful of raw and whole plant vitamins. For me, breakfast is about efficiency. —[Jeremy Stanley][13]

Usually, I have cereal, milk, eggs, and sometimes a sandwich. —[Manaswini Das][14]

I'm not super hungry in the morning, but as a coffee fanatic, I always have two cups of coffee with cream. If I'm good, I'll also make a smoothie or have a cup of Greek yogurt. Today's breakfast was a banana and one cup of coffee with cinnamon roll creamer. —[Lauren Maffeo][15]

Coffee and/or tea in copious amounts (tea can be close to a liter in one of my mugs) and maybe a breakfast sandwich. —[John Hawley][16]

For breakfast, I have bread from a local bakery with cheese from Bavaria and sausage from Italy. —[Stephan Avenwedde][17]

I usually have a bowl of Crunchy Raisin Bran cereal, an apple, and several cups of black coffee. —[Alan Formy-Duval][18]

Whatever I eat, [expect tea][19]. —[Mike Bursell][20]

Now that you know how our contributors fuel up, what's the quick breakfast that helps you get started on your workday? Please share your favorites in the comments.
