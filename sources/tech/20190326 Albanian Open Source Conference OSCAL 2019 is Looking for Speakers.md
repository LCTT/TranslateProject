Albanian Open Source Conference OSCAL 2019 is Looking for Speakers
======

![][1]

The sixth installment of Albanian Open Source Community’s annual conference [OSCAL][2] (Open Source Conference Albania) is scheduled for 18th & 19th May, 2019.

![OSCAL’18][3]

OSCAL is the first annual conference in Albania organized to promote software freedom, open source software, free culture and open knowledge. It is organized by [Open Labs][4], an Albanian non-profit organization dedicated to promote open source. The conference will take place in Tirana, the capital on Albania.

### Theme for OSCAL ’19

This year, OSCAL is expecting to have over 300 enthusiasts of open source, libre software, privacy oriented people. The participants will gather to increase knowledge and engage in various discussions, while sharing the common belief of a decentralized world.

The main theme of this year will be ‘Ethical Tech’. In a world where self-driving cars, AI, personal assistants are reigning, we must be careful that these tools are for the better of the society. This crucial point will be thought about and discussed on.

### Timings and Opportunities

OSCAL will be from 9AM to 6PM on both days. Participants will be able to explore and be acquainted with work and contribution opportunities in open source. Fedore, LibreOffice, Mozilla, NextCloud, Wikipedia, OpenStreetMap are few of the projects that the participants can interact with.

### Call for Proposals
