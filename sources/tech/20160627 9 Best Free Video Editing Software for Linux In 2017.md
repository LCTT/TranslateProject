[Cinelerra][37] has been available since 1998 and has been downloaded over 5 million times. It was the first video editor to provide non-linear editing on 64-bit systems back in 2003. It was a go-to video editor for Linux users at that time but it lost its sheen afterward as some developers abandoned the project.

![VidCutter video editor for Linux][1]

![VidCutter video editor for Linux][43]

Unlike all the other video editors discussed here, [VidCutter][44] is utterly simple. It doesn't do much except splitting videos and merging. But at times you just need this and VidCutter gives you just that.

It is available in AUR so Arch Linux users can also install it easily. For other Linux distributions, you can find the installation files on its [GitHub page][45].

### Which is the best video editing software for Linux?

A number of video editors mentioned here use [FFmpeg][46]. You can use FFmpeg on your own as well. It's a command line only tool so I didn't include it in the main list but it would have been unfair to not mention it at all.

If you need an editor for simply cutting and joining videos, go with VidCutter.

If you need something more than that, **OpenShot** or **Kdenlive** is a good choice. These are suitable for beginners and a system with standard specification.

If you have a high-end computer and need advanced features you can go out with **Lightworks** or **DaVinci Resolve**. If you are looking for more advanced features for 3D works, **Blender** has got your back.

So that's all I can write about the ** best video editing software for Linux** such as Ubuntu, Linux Mint, Elementary, and other Linux distributions. Share with us which video editor you like the most.
