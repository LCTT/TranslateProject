Guake Terminal: A Customizable Linux Terminal for Power Users [Inspired by an FPS Game]
======

_**Brief: Quickly access your terminal that is customizable and powerful for a variety of users with Guake Terminal emulator.**_

### Guake Terminal: Top-Down Terminal for GNOME Desktop

![][1]

[Guake][2] is a terminal emulator that’s tailored for GNOME desktop with a top-down design.

It was originally inspired from the terminal seen in an FPS game ([Quake][3]). Even though it was initially built as a quick and accessible terminal, it is much more than that.

Guake terminal offers a ton of features, and customizable options. Here, I’ll highlight the key features of the terminal along with the process of getting it installed on any of your Linux distribution.

### Features of Guake Terminal

![][4]

  * Keyboard Shortcut (**F12**) to launch the terminal anywhere as an overlay
  * Guake terminal runs in the background for persistent access
  * Ability to split tabs horizontally and vertically
  * Change the default shell from available options (if any)
  * Re-alignment option
  * Change appearance of the terminal from a wide selection of color palettes
  * Ability to save the content of the terminal to a file using GUI option
  * Toggle Full screen option when needed
  * You can easily save the tabs or open new tabs when needed
  * Ability to restore tabs
  * Option to configure and learn new keyboard shortcuts to quickly access the terminal and perform tasks
  * Change colors of specific tabs
  * Easily rename the tabs to quickly access what you already need
  * Quick open feature to open text files directly from your terminal on your favorite editor with a click
  * Ability to add your own command or scripts when starting up or showing up the Guake terminal
  * Multi-monitor support

Just to have fun, you can do a great deal of things. But, I also believe that power users can make use of the features to make their terminal experience easier and more productive.

For the time I used it to test out a few things and write this article, I felt like I was summoning the terminal to be honest. So, I definitely find it cool!

### Installing Guake Terminal on Linux

![][6]

**Guake Terminal is available through the default repositories on Ubuntu, Fedora, and Arch**.

You can follow its official instructions to know the commands you can use or if you’re using an Ubuntu-based distro, simply type in:

```
sudo apt install guake
```

Do note that you may not get the latest version using this method. So, if you want to have the latest version, you can opt to use the PPA by [Linux Uprising][7] to get the latest version:

```
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:linuxuprising/guake
sudo apt update
sudo apt install guake
```

In either case, you can also get it using [Pypi][8] or from source by referring to the [official documentation][9] or the [GitHub page][10].
