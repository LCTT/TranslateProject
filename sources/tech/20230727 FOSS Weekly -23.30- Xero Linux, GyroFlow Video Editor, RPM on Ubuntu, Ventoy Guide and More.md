The Bash Basics series is nearing its end. A Virtual Box series will follow it and it will cover everything from the installation to VM creation, backup, restore etc.

So, in 2023, we have had Terminal Basics, Rust Basics, Bash Basics and NixOS series so far. I plan to publish three more series by the end of the year. I hope you are enjoying them 😎

  * Inkscape has received a new release with many new features.
  * We take a look at Gyroflow, an open-source video editor.
