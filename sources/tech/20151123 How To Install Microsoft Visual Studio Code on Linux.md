How To Install Microsoft Visual Studio Code on Linux
================================================================================
Visual Studio code (VScode) is the cross-platform Chromium-based code editor is being open sourced today by Microsoft. How do I install Microsoft Visual Studio Code on a Debian or Ubuntu or Fedora Linux desktop?

Visual Studio supports debugging Linux apps and code editor now open source by Microsoft. It is a preview (beta) version but you can test it and use it on your own Linux based desktop.

### Why use Visual Studio Code? ###

From the project website:

> Visual Studio Code provides developers with a new choice of developer tool that combines the simplicity and streamlined experience of a code editor with the best of what developers need for their core code-edit-debug cycle. Visual Studio Code is the first code editor, and first cross-platform development tool - supporting OS X, Linux, and Windows - in the Visual Studio family. If you use Unity, ASP.NET 5, NODE.JS or related tool, give it a try.

### Requirements for Visual Studio Code on Linux ###

1. Ubuntu Desktop version 14.04
1. GLIBCXX version 3.4.15 or later
1. GLIBC version 2.15 or later

The following installation instructions are tested on:

1. Fedora Linux 22 and 23
1. Debian Linux 8
1. Ubuntu Linux 14.04 LTS

### Download Visual Studio Code ###

### Alternate install method ###

You can use the wget command to download VScode as follows:

    $ wget 'https://az764295.vo.msecnd.net/public/0.10.1-release/VSCode-linux64.zip'

Sample outputs:

### Install VScode using the command line ###

Cd to ~/Download/ location, enter:

    $ cd ~/Download/
    $ ls -l

Sample outputs:

Unzip VSCode-linux64.zip in /usr/local/ directory, enter:

    $ sudo unzip VSCode-linux64.zip -d /usr/local/

Cd into /usr/local/ to create the soft-link as follows using the ln command for the Code executable. This is useful to run VSCode from the terminal application:

    $ su -
    # cd /usr/local/
    # ls -l
    # cd bin/
    # ln -s ../VSCode-linux-x64/Code code
    # exit

Sample session:

### How do I use VSCode on Linux? ###

And, there you have it, the VSCode installed and working correctly on the latest version of Debian, Ubuntu and Fedora Linux. I suggest that you read [getting started pages from Microsoft][2] to understand the core concepts that will make you more productive writing and navigating your code.
