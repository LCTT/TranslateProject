20 ways to be more productive and respect yourself
======
Open source tools and more efficient processes can give you an edge over
your to-do list.
![Kanban-style organization action][1]

The need to be productive is ingrained in who we are as human beings on some level. We oftentimes have to do yoga and meditate and breathe deeply in order to consciously slow down our minds and bodies, but when we do it helps us focus and be more productive when the time comes. Instead of constantly moving and doing, we should take periods of thoughtful breaks... or veg out in front of the TV or a sunset. And sleep at night! Then, when we're ready again, we can tackle that to-do list. Rinse and repeat.

Honoring this cycle of moving through active and restful states, our productivity series this year brought to us by author [Kevin Sonney][2] showcases open source tools and more efficient processes while paying attention to healthy practices for incorporating them and respecting the person doing the implementing, you.

### Tools and technology
