How to Upgrade to Ubuntu 22.10 From 22.04 LTS (Jammy to Kinetic)
======

**Here are the steps on how to upgrade your current Ubuntu 22.04 LTS Jammy Jellyfish to Ubuntu 22.10 Kinetic Kudu.**

Always stay with long-term support release. That is the thumb rule. So, the prior [Ubuntu 22.04 LTS][1] Jammy Jellyfish is supported until April 2027. That’s a long time.

In addition, LTS releases are super stable. They rarely break and become unstable. So, if you use your laptop/desktop or server installation with the LTS version, stay with it.

However, if you want the latest Kernel, GNOME 43, and new technology like Pipewire – you might want to make the jump and want to upgrade to [Ubuntu 22.10 Kinetic Kudu][2].

Here’s how.

### Upgrade Ubuntu 22.04 LTS (Jammy Jellyfish) to Ubuntu 22.10 (Kinetic Kudu)

**Note**: I hope you are not running Ubuntu 21.10 Impish Indri, released last October. Because that’s out of support. But for any reason, if you are still running it, I would recommend you do a fresh install of 22.10. Or, do a step upgrade to 22.04 and then 22.10.

#### Before you upgrade

Before you upgrade, do a little housekeeping. This is super important.

- Take backups of your `/home`, /`downloads` and other files to USB or any separate partition in case the upgrade fails.

- If you have added additional PPA over time, make sure you note them down. However, the upgrade process would disable the PPA before it starts. However, after the upgrade is complete, make sure to enable them manually.

- Note down and disable all the GNOME Extensions. Extensions tend to break after the upgrade if it’s not updated by the developer aligned with the GNOME version.

- Keep a LIVE USB stick handy.

#### Upgrade steps

- Open Software & Update.

- Go to the Updates tab.

- Select ‘`Notify me of a new Ubuntu version'`and change it to `'For any new version'.`

- This will tell the package manager to look for the Ubuntu 22.10 release details.

- Open a terminal and run below.

```
sudo apt updatesudo apt upgrade
```

Alternatively, you can open the Software Updater as well. Install all the pending packages.

- Once both the commands are complete, open the ‘Software Updates’. And you will see a prompt to Upgrade to Ubuntu 22.10 (as shown in the below image).

- Now click on the `Upgrade` button and follow the on-screen instructions. The upgrade process takes time, so be patient and wait until it finishes. Make sure you have stable internet connectivity for the entire upgrade process.

If you still don’t get the update, wait a day or two and try.

- If you do not see the above prompt, do a manual reboot of your system. Add try again.

**Via terminal**

- Open the following file via the nano file editor in the terminal.

```
nano /etc/update-manager/release-upgrades
```

- Change the `Prompt=LTS` to `Prompt=normal`. Note: If you have changed the updates tab to “For any new version” as mentioned above, then this file should be updated already. But verify once.

- Press CTRL+O and CTRL+X to save and exit.

- Finally, you can also run the below command to force the upgrade process from the terminal.

```
sudo do-release-upgrade -c
```

The upgrade process will take some time (minimum half-hour or more) based on your internet connection and hardware. Wait until it is complete. Once done, restart and enjoy the Ubuntu 22.10 Kinetic Kudu.
