Try FreeDOS in 2022
======
15 resources for new users and longtime fans of this free operating
system.
![Puzzle pieces coming together to form a computer screen][1]

Throughout the 1980s and into the 1990s, DOS was king of the desktop. Not satisfied with a proprietary version of DOS, programmers worldwide worked together to create an open source version of DOS called FreeDOS, which first became available in 1994. [The FreeDOS Project][2] continues to grow in 2021 and beyond.

We've run several articles about FreeDOS on Opensource.com to help new users get started with FreeDOS and learn new programs. Here are a few of our most popular FreeDOS articles from the last year:

### New to FreeDOS

Are you new to FreeDOS? If you'd like to learn the basics of how to boot and run FreeDOS, check out these articles:

Throughout its nearly 30-year journey, FreeDOS has tried to be a modern DOS. If you'd like to learn more, you can read about the origins and development of FreeDOS in [A brief history of FreeDOS][18]. Also, check out Don Watkins' interview about FreeDOS in [How a college student founded a free and open source operating system][19].

If you'd like to try FreeDOS, download FreeDOS 1.3 RC5, released in December 2021. This version has a ton of new changes and improvements, including an updated kernel and command shell, new programs and games, better international support, and network support. Download FreeDOS 1.3 RC5 from the [FreeDOS website][2].
