Top 10 Linux Distributions for KDE Plasma [Compared]
======
Are you planning to adopt a stable KDE Plasma-based desktop in Linux and thinking about it as a daily driver? Well, here we present the top 10 Linux distributions better integrated with KDE Plasma.

KDE Plasma desktop is used by millions today. And with an active set of developers and community, it is improving every day with new features aligning with technology trends. The KDE technology evolved over the years to reach a point where it is now running on desktops, laptops, tabs, mobile phones and hand-held gaming devices. It’s incredible, isn’t it, for a desktop environment?

Often I hear or read about bugs in KDE Desktop, or it is being termed as “too many options” compared to GNOME. I agree with that. But we can not ignore the fact that despite all those arguments & opinions – the KDE Plasma desktop is a “go-to” solution for any individual or enterprise use case. It has a well-established road map, built on unique Qt technology that can even run on automobiles and other platforms, Plus a dedicated foundation with a huge set of developers working every day to polish this desktop.

That brings me to the purpose of writing this article. There are hundreds of Linux distributions featuring the KDE Plasma desktop. But which one to choose? What are their advantages or disadvantages? Which is best for me? We try to cover all these questions in this article and help you decide on your own.

### Top 10 Linux Distributions for KDE Plasma Desktop

I have compiled the following list in terms of use cases and not much in technical terms – such as installation, terminal usage, etc.

#### 1. Kubuntu

![Kubuntu Desktop][1]

[Kubuntu][2] is an official KDE Plasma Desktop flavour of the Ubuntu Linux operating system. It uses same set of underlying packages of Ubuntu and follow Ubuntu release schedule. That means it releases a new version when Ubuntu does. As it is based on Ubuntu, you get a huge help and support community that comes with Kubuntu flavour. This official Ubuntu flavour is the most used KDE Plasma desktop today.

**Pros**

* Very stable system in terms of bugs – both LTS and non-LTS versions
* LTS versions have 5 years of support
* Huge community-based help system
* Easy to use

**Cons**

* Delay of around 6 months to receive latest from KDE Plasma desktop. The reason being stability that Ubuntu requires.

[Download Kubuntu][3]

#### 2. KDE Neon

[KDE Neon][4] is the official Linux distribution which features the latest KDE Plasma Desktop, KDE Framework and KDE Applications from KDE Community. This Linux distribution directly comes from the KDE Development team and is based on Ubuntu. KDE Neon comes with two variants. A User edition and a Developer’s Edition. The User Edition is for everyone who wants to experience the latest KDE Plasma desktop that is tested and ready to use. But it may have some little bugs – but not a dealbreaker, if you ask me. The Developer edition for, as it says – for developers with cutting-edge packages. This is ideal for those who are a little experienced in the Linux platform and have time to get around occasional problems. But this is also reasonably stable.

![KDE Neon Desktop][5]

**Pros**

* Latest KDE Applications, Packages and Framework
* Based on the Ubuntu base
* First to receive new KDE Plasma Versions

**Cons**

* It May contain occasional bugs

[Download KDE Neon][6]

#### 3. Fedora KDE Edition

[Fedora Linux][7] is an RPM package manager-based Linux distribution that is community-supported and owned by Red Hat. This free and open-source Linux distribution features leading-edge packages and technology and supports a KDE Plasma edition. Although its official edition features GNOME desktop, but an official KDE Plasma “spin” is available. You get the latest KDE Packages with each Fedora release, which happens twice a year. Ideally, it’s similar to Kubuntu; the only difference is its underlying package management and a different sponsoring company.

![KDE Plasma in Fedora Linux][8]

**Pros**

* Well-designed and stable Linux Distribution
* New KDE Plasma releases twice a year
* Suitable for new and advanced users
* Versatile community support

**Cons**

* Fedora Linux with KDE may feel a little complex for absolute new Linux users

[Download Fedora KDE Edition][9]

#### 4. OpenSUSE KDE Edition

The [openSUSE][10] is a complete Linux Distribution targeted for new and experienced users. This is sponsored by SUSE Linux and other companies. It supports KDE Plasma desktop as one of the desktop offerings. With OpenSUSE KDE Edition, you can get a rolling release version (aka Tumbleweed) with the latest KDE technology and a long-term-support version with stable and well-tested KDE Plasma (aka Leap). If you’re a non-Ubuntu, non-Fedora KDE Plasma flavour, then this is the one you should choose.

![KDE Plasma in OpenSUSE][11]

**Pros**

* Well-established Linux Distribution commercially, hence a quality Linux with KDE
* Provides both rolling and long-term-support release
* Support a wide variant of hardware out of the box (single board devices, thin clients terminals, desktops, laptops, PowerPC and more)

**Cons**

* Probably a less famous Linux Distribution hence free support via forums might be less

[Download OpenSUSE KDE Edition (Leap)][12]

#### 5. Manjaro KDE Edition

[Manjaro][13] Linux is an Arch Linux-based Linux distribution that follows a rolling release model. It is a very fast, user-friendly desktop operating system which gives several benefits such as automatic hardware detection, multiple Linux Kernel support and well-designed configuration settings. Both Manjaro with KDE Plasma is perfect for those with a little knowledgeable person in Linux who wants to experience Arch Linux with KDE.

**Pros**

* Rolling release brings the latest KDE Plasma Desktop packages within a week or two after the official Plasma release
* Provides options to GUI installers for Arch
* Good community support via forums

**Cons**

* Arch Linux-based distributions sometimes become buggy and unstable due to continuous package updates
* It May not be suitable for absolutely new users or those aiming for a stable system that runs for multiple years without re-installations

[Download Manjaro KDE][14]

#### 6. EndeavourOS KDE Edition

[EndeavourOS][15] is a fairly new Arch-Linux based Linux distribution that supports KDE Plasma as of their offerings. It provides an easy-to-use installation and pre-configured desktop environment. The one of the best-selling point of this Linux is you get to choose what you install and GUI based desktop-tweak scripts that comes preloaded. A growling Linux distribution which looks promising.

**Pros**

* Easy installation for Arch Linux based – KDE Plasma Desktop
* One-click ready-made scripts to perform various desktop actions (such as updates)
* Supports multiple Linux Kernel versions for Arch
* Perfect for new users who wants to experience and learn Arch with KDE Plasma

**Cons**

* Fairly new Linux Distribution and community supported
* Difficult to commit to this distribution if you are an organization planning to adopt KDE Plasma with this flavour for multiple installation units.

[Download EndeavourOS][16]

#### 7. MX Linux KDE Edition

[MX Linux][17] is a Linux distribution based on Debian’s Stable branch. Debian is a Universal Linux Operating System, the father of Ubuntu and all derivatives. It’s the core of all those Linux distribution. It rarely breaks and gives you an unstable system. With the power of Debian, MX Linux brings its flavours by providing its in-house utilities and packages. It’s KDE edition is perfect for all users, especially if you want a stable KDE Desktop which runs for years. But you may not get the latest technology immediately, as Debian’s release cycle has been slower in years. That means that to get the latest KDE plasma technology, you may need to wait 1.5 to 2 years.

**Pros**

* Stable Linux with well-tested KDE Plasma packages
* It can be suitable for systems where stability trumps the latest features
* Suitable for new users and advanced ones
* Provides good coverage for low-end and older hardware
* One of the best In-house utilities provided by MX Linux for various desktop tasks

**Cons**

* It follows Debian’s stable releases. Hence KDE Plasma desktop version upgrades take years to reach you.

[Download MX Linux KDE Edition][18]

#### 8. Garuda Linux

[Garuda Linux][19]is also an Arch-based rolling release distribution that provides KDE Plasma desktop as it’s one of the flavours. It comes with an easy-to-use Calamares installer and other graphical tools to manage your desktop.

The significant difference between Garuda with other Arch-based distributions is it provides some tools out of the box for managing your system performance. Some of them are zram, CPU Governor, and custom tools for memory management.

**Pros**

* Arch-based Linux with custom tools for memory management
* Official KDE Plasma flavour

**Cons**

* Very new Linux distribution with its first release on March 2020
* It requires a relatively high-end hardware to work correctly (Minimum 8GB RAM, 40 GB Storage)

[Download Garuda Linux][20]

#### 9. Nitrux

This is a unique Linux distribution for KDE Plasma. I wanted to add this to this list because of only the out-of-the-box looks it provides. Nitrux is a Linux distribution that is based on Debian’s unstable SID branch. This only provides a customized KDE Plasma desktop that is enhanced with “plasmoids”, Kvantum themes. Technically the desktop is called NX-Desktop, a KDE Plasma variant with all those look and feel changes. This Linux distribution provides the latest KDE Plasma tech as it’s based on Debian unstable branch and uses AppImage for application deployments.

**Pros**

* One of the best-customized versions of the KDE Plasma desktop is available out of the box.
* Aesthetically pleasing with Nitrix icons and themes with the power of Kvuntum.
* Support of AppImage

**Cons**

* Sometimes it is unstable due to the Debian SID branch
* Complete dependency on AppImage sometimes creates a problem
* Not a suitable distribution for beginners users of KDE Plasma

[Download Nitrux][21]

#### 10. KaOS

The final distribution I would like to mention here is [KaOS][22] because of its uniqueness. KaOS is a specially designed Linux distribution that provides bleeding-edge KDE Plasma desktop with a special focus on Qt and KDE. It is a rolling release Linux distribution and not based on Ubuntu/Fedora. It is an independent Linux distribution. Furthermore, it provides packages via in-house repositories that provides an extra quality over direct packages from Arch Linux. It is only available for 64-bit systems.

**Pros**

* Well-designed KDE Plasma ready to use for new users
* Rolling release with in-house repository gives latest KDE Plasma with extra quality in terms of stability

**Cons**

* Not so popular, and hence you may get less support in terms of forums, Google search.
* It may not ready yet for absolutely new users, as printing errors may require a little more Linux knowledge.

[Download KaOS][23]

### Honorary Mentions of other KDE Plasma-based Linux distributions

Apart from the above list, you may want to check out vanilla Debian stable with KDE Desktop installed from scratch. That would give you the stability of Debian with the customized KDE packages you want. You can follow our [Debian installation guide][24] to get it going.

Also, one of the Linux distributions I think needed a mention here – is [Q4OS][25]. The reason is it provides Trinity desktop environment, which is a KDE 3 fork. Not the latest KDE Plasma 5+ series. The earlier KDE 3 version was adorable, with its own set of aesthetics. Those who like earlier KDE Desktop and widgets may want to check out Q4OS.

### How to find out which is the best KDE Plasma Linux distribution for you?

Several factors are involved when you decide on a Linux distribution and Desktop environment. For example, you might always need bleeding-edge latest KDE tech, and it’s okay if it’s a little unstable. On the other hand, you might need rock-solid stability and may not require the latest KDE tech. So, holding on to that thought here’s a quick comparison table we prepared for you to help you decide.

### Conclusion

We have covered a list of the best Linux distributions that feature KDE Plasma desktop. We also listed some pros and cons with comparisons. Now, which is the best for you or your team/school/organization – is up to you to choose. But honestly, that depends on the use case, the situations you are in, or the problem you are trying to solve by adopting the KDE Plasma desktop.

The choice is subjective, and everyone has a different taste. With that in mind, I hope this gives you some guidance in adopting a KDE Plasma desktop with a perfect Linux distribution. Let me know your opinion on the above list and the comparison in the comment box below.
