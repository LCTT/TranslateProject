Get Premium Linux eBooks Worth $723 for $15 [Humble Bundle Deal]
======

[Humble Bundle][1] is a digital e-store that provides limited-time massive discount deals on games, eBooks and audiobooks. Things that would normally cost you hundreds of dollars are made available in under $20. That’s not it. Part of each sale goes to a charity. In fact, they have raised over $155 million in charities so far.

So you get awesome stuff at unbelievable prices and at the same time you support a charity organization. Humble Bundle deals are ethically satisfying for this reason.

Humble Bundle has offered awesome eBooks bundles on a wide variety of topics in the past. Android app development, Python, Ruby, Cyber Security, Raspberry Pi are a few examples. I usually share relevant Humble Bundle deals in It’s FOSS weekly newsletter and they are loved by many of our subscribers.

Last year, I requested them for a [Linux Bundle deal][2] and they happily obliged it by creating a bundle offer of No Starch Press Linux books. It was a huge success for both Humble Bundle and No Starch Press with over 30,000 bundles sold.

Humble Bundle and No Starch Press have partnered again to bring another Linux (and BSD) book bundle. They have added new books to the offering this year.

### Linux &amp; BSD Bookshelf by Humble Bundle

![][4]

The [Linux &amp; BSD Bookshelf][3] bundle consists of eBooks from No Starch Press. [No Starch Press][5] is a publishing house specializing in technical literature focused on geek, hacker, and DIY subcultures. They have some really good books like How Linux Works, The Linux Command Line etc.

The Linux and BSD book bundle has books worth $723. All of the eBooks can be downloaded in PDF, ePUB and MOBI format. Once purchased, you can download the books any time in the future from your Humble Bundle account. Books are [DRM-free][6] which means you own the book and can transfer it to any device you own. 

Part of your purchase will be donated to either No Starch Press Foundation or [Electronic Frontier Foundation][7] (EFF), an international non-profit fighting for privacy, transparency and net neutrality. You can also choose to donate part of the purchase to It’s FOSS as we are partners with Humble Bundle.

#### Don’t miss the deal

It’s not every day that I write about deals unless it’s something really awesome and useful for Linux users like you. This is one of those rare deals that I highly recommend. The deal is a win-win for a number of reasons.

  * DRM-free Linux and programming eBooks in PDF, MOBI and ePub formats
  * Books can be downloaded any time in future
  * You can gift the book bundle to a friend, colleague or family member
  * Indirectly contribute to EFF in fighting for Net Neutrality



You may not need all the books in the bundle but a few books like How Linux Works itself are good enough for buying the entire bundle. Go and buy it. You won’t get such an awesome deal anytime soon.
