Ubuntu 22.10: Top New Features and Release Wiki
======
Here’s the list of new features and tech which is coming up in Ubuntu 22.10 Kinetic Kudu.

![Ubuntu 22.10 Kinetic Kudu Desktop (dev)][1]

The development of Ubuntu 22.10 is almost at the finishing stage, and the BETA is out. At this stage, features are frozen, and only testing/bug fixes are ongoing for Ubuntu 22.10.

In this article, I will touch upon the essential features of Ubuntu 22.10 Kinetic Kudu. But before that, a quick summary of the schedule.

Ubuntu 22.10 BETA was released on September 29, 2022, and it’s currently under testing.

The final release of Ubuntu 22.10 is on October 20, 2022.

Since it is a short-term release, it is supported for nine months until July 20, 2023.

### Ubuntu 22.10 Kinetic Kudu Desktop: Top Features

Following the letter-based code name, we are at “K” following the “J” of Jammy Jellyfish. This version is code-named “Kinetic Kudu”, named after a [long-horned animal species][2] found in Africa.

All the packages and repos are named as “kinetic” in applicable places for this release.

#### Linux Kernel

Ubuntu 22.10 features Linux Kernel 5.19, which was released a few days back. The current mainline kernel, which is dubbed as [version 6.0][3], won’t feature in this version due to a schedule mismatch.

Linux Kernel 5.19 brings regular updates across CPU, GPU and other peripherals. Significant features in this Kernel include multi-platform ARM support, LoongArch arch support, support for AMD RDNA, CDNA, Intel’s Raptor Lake and many important updates. You can read in detail about its new features on [this page][4].

#### GNOME 43

In Ubuntu 22.10, GNOME 43 is the base desktop version. GNOME 43 is an impressive release in terms of features and work around the GTK4 and libadwaita. A lot of features which was missed to reach in Ubuntu 22.04 LTS, finally arrived in this version.

Since the feature list is vast, I will try to summarize it here.

First and foremost, GNOME Shell gets high-resolution scroll wheel support, colour support in server decoration, and improved animation and performance all around the desktop.

Secondly, the vital app – Files (Nautilus) 43 brings a vast set of tweaks after its migration to GTK4. In Files 43, you get the redesigned context menu, rubberband selection, adaptive sidebar, which auto-hides based on its size, emblems support and new GtkColumnView support for a better experience.

Third, the stunning [GNOME 43 quick settings][5] arrive in Ubuntu. The settings will give you easy access to several key items right from the tray.

Other important changes in GNOME 43 include:

* An updated properties dialog window with intelligent behaviour based on file types
* GNOME Web gets web extension API support enabling you to install Firefox and Chrome add-ons
* Improved context menu in Files sidebar
* Updated app info page in Software

Don’t forget to review my detailed [GNOME 43 feature write-up][6] to learn more.

#### New Settings Panel

There are some [key changes][7] arrive in the Settings panel. A new panel is introduced – “Ubuntu Desktop” which has the desktop icon and dock options. This panel is unavailable in vanilla GNOME (e.g. in Fedora Workstation).

![New Ubuntu desktop and Appearance tab in settings][8]

The Background tab is now merged with the Appearance tab. This essentially consolidates Ubuntu’s theming options to one single setting page. Effectively, it’s a good change and a wise UI decision. In addition, a new “Device Security Panel” is also introduced.

#### PipeWire by Default

Ubuntu 22.10 is all about adopting the new tech, and leaving the legacy items behind. With that motto, in this release, the Pipewire sound server is made default for the first time in Ubuntu. PulseAudio will still be there but inactive for now.

For those folks in Audio recording, mixing work would greatly benefit from this.

#### IWD replacing the wpa_supplicant

Similarly, with PipeWire, another new tech adoption is coming in Ubuntu 22.10. The legacy `wpa_supplicant` wireless module is changing, and IWD (iNet Wireless Daemon) is replacing it. The IWD was developed by Intel, and it had certain advantages and more features over wpa_supplicant.

Besides, the wpa_supplicant is almost two decades old and served its purpose in GNU/Linux and BSD systems.

In my personal experience, I had some difficult experiences with wpa_supplicant, which manages the Wi-Fi connections. For example, sudden disconnection, and not waking up the Wi-Fi after standby, to name a few.

With the modern IWD, I hope the continuous struggle with several users with Ubuntu and Wi-Fi shall disappear. If you want to learn more about IWD, you can read some excellent discussions [here][9] and [here][10].

#### Official desktop flavours

All the official desktop flavours of Ubuntu are getting their current stable release. If you are already using Xubuntu, Ubuntu MATE – well, you get the same version as the prior one. Because these desktops did not have a major upgrade recently.

Lubuntu users should get the recently released LXQt 1.1.0 desktop which brings additional features such as compact and a new application menu, new theming changes and more.

Kubuntu users should get KDE Plasma 5.25, which brings you some unique features such as a floating panel, dynamic accent colour and many [such exciting features][11].

Budgie lovers should get the new features that are under development via Ubuntu Budgie 22.10. I will write up a separate article on Budgie because of the changes.

So, in summary, you get [Xfce 4.16][12], MATE 1.24, KDE Plasma 5.25 and LXQt 1.1.0 as the desktop versions.

#### Tool-chain updates

Now, it’s time to find out about the important packages and programming updates for developers. In this release, you get the following version upgrades for individual items.

* BlueZ 5.65
* CUPS 2.4
* Python 3.10.6
* NetworkManager 1.38
* Mesa 22
* Pipewire 0.3.56
* PulseAudio 16
* xdg-desktop-portal 1.14

Although, I am not sure whether Python 3.11 will be ready ([currently in RC][13]) before release. I hope not.

#### Wallpaper

Finally, a brand new wallpaper featuring the official Kudu mascot is ready to give your desktop a nice touch.
