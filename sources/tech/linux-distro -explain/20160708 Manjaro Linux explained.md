# Manjaro Linux explained

Today we have Manjaro on our seventh segment. Manjaro is based on Arch Linux with a beautiful user interface. Manjaro is not much older like Debian or Arch but still it emerged as a stable and reliable Linux Distribution,standing and differentiating itself in the crowd of Distros. In 2011 there was the first initial release of Manjaro. Since then it improved a lot and today we are having the latest version 16.06.1 codenamed 'Daniella'. 

**So why should We consider Manjaro over other Linux Distributions?**We are not telling you to use Manjaro instead of other distributions, but we are going to give you reasons to think about it.So let's start it.

*   ** Based on Arch:  **As many people know or think, Arch is absolutely a no joke distribution. Newbies find it difficult to use. Many newbies find it hard to install as Arch Linux doesn't have graphical installer. On the other hand , Manjaro have a graphical installer which is easy to use. So people or newbies who are thinking to try Arch (but doubting on difficulties) can use Manjaro. Manjaro is easy to install and it have user friendly UI.

*   **Desktop Environments:  **Manjaro has quite a lot choices when it comes to desktop environments. It gives variety of choices like Xfce, KDE, Deepin, BspWM, Budgie, i3, LXDE, Cinnamon, Enlightenment, Netbook, Fluxbox, Gnome, JWM, LXQT, MATE, Openbox and PekWM. In all this desktop environments Manjaro works like a charm. The official desktop environments of Manjaro are Xfce and KDE, while other DE are community supported. We are currently using KDE Plasma desktop ewnvironment on Manjaro 16.06.1.

*   **Stability and Package Management: **Manjaro may be new but it is stable. Latest version of Manjaro ships with Linux kernel 4.6.2. Manjaro is not only stable, but also it is bleeding edge. It brings latest updates on softwares as soon as it gets compiled in repositories. Manjaro uses pacman for package management. Pacman is already famous due to Arch Linux (and game ofcourse). To get more user-friendly Manjaro uses Octopi, a graphical frontend for Pacman which is written in Qt. Manjaro also maintains it's own repositories so there's always an advantage of that.

*   **Community support: ** Manjaro is also a community based linux like many others. There are always people to help you out whenever you need it. Apart from Xfce and KDE (which are officially maintained) all other desktop environments are compiled and maintained by Manjaro community. If any user is in problem he can always count on community to help him and he can beassured to get help from actual Manjaro users.

These are just a few reasons,which we've listed out here. You will get many as you will get your hands over it. 

**Still thinking about installing it ?** If you're still confused about Manjaro then You can also give it  try in Virtualbox and then can install it in actual machine, if you liked it. We are also posting this topic on Manjaro 16.06.1\. So Guys have fun with Linux and stay tuned with us because we are bringing more segments to this series. Keep visiting us for more interesting stuffs on Linux.
