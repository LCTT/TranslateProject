Oh, Bummer! Rocket League is Ending Support For Linux
======

If you’ve enjoyed playing Rocket League on Linux, you will be disappointed to know that [Pysonix][1], the developer team behind Rocket League [announced][2] that they will be dropping support for Linux and Mac in March, 2020.

If it was just another casual game on [Steam][3], I wouldn’t mind- but Rocket League is a quite popular online multiplayer game across every platform.

In fact, Rocket League was one of my [favorite games to play on Linux][5] (in addition to CS: GO). Even though I haven’t played it for a while – it is a bummer that I won’t be able to play it either.

So, this is definitely sad for Linux gamers who were looking forward to having fun in a popular online multiplayer game that required a decent hardware configuration to work flawlessly.

### Why are they ending support?

In their [announcement][2], they mentioned:

> As we continue to upgrade _**Rocket League**_ with new technologies, it is no longer viable for us to maintain support for the macOS and Linux (SteamOS) platforms. As a result, the final patch for the macOS and Linux versions of the game will be in March. This update will disable online functionality (such as in-game purchases) for players on macOS and Linux, but offline features including Local Matches, and splitscreen play will still be accessible.

Well, this certainly does not explain why they’re dropping support for Linux/Mac. But, it looks like the game will get its final patches in March.

**After that, you will not be able to play multiplayer sessions – but will be restricted to the local multiplayer sessions (or split-screen)**.

Maybe you can try using [Wine][7] or [Steam Play][8] to play it on Linux? Doesn’t sound good though.

Some furious users/gamers on [Reddit][9] mentioned that this is a result of Epic Games acquiring Rocket League developer **Psyonix**. I wouldn’t comment on that one – feel free to share your thoughts in the comments though.

### How to get a refund for your Rocket League purchase

![][10]

To get a refund for your purchase of the Rocket League, you need to open a ticket on the [Psyonix Support][11] page.

If you’ve purchased it recently in the ongoing Steam sale – you might just get an instant refund from Steam if you initiate a refund.

If you have no plans to play it on a Windows machine (or trying Proton/Wine) on Linux – you should apply for a refund.

**Wrapping Up**

While this may not be a big-shot game for the platform but dropping support for Linux is not helping to improve the gaming scene on Linux.

If a game that worked quite well on Linux drops support for it – how can we expect newer games to consider adding support for Linux?

Feel free to share your thoughts in the comments down below.
