How to Install Viber in Ubuntu and Other Linux
======

**Here’s a quick guide on how you can install Viber in Ubuntu and other Linux systems.**

[Viber][1] is a free, secure calling and messaging program for all popular mobile platforms and operating systems.

It has a rich set of features such as voice/video calls, text messages with GIFs, stickers, photos, and videos. In addition, Viber features group chats, group calls and disappearing messages.

Viber is a closed-source program, but available as free for Linux distributions with native executable clients.

Here’s how to install it.

### Install Viber on Linux

It is available as an AppImage executable, deb and rpm package. Follow the respective button below to download it directly. The average executable size is ~180MB.

RPM package for Fedora

If you have downloaded AppImage, simply change the permission to executable from any file manager. Then run.

- For Ubuntu, Linux Mint, Debian and related distributions, you can install deb package via [many methods][4].

- You may double-click and open via the installed software manager. Or install via dpkg command as below.

```
sudo dpkg -i viber.deb
```

- For Fedora and RPM-based packages, you can install via the following command.

```
sudo dnf localinstall viber.rpm
```

For Arch Linux and other distributions, you can use the Appimage as I explained above.

### Usage

After you finish installing Viber, open it via the application menu. Here are a couple of things you need to remember.

Before you start using Viber from your Laptop/desktop, you need to set it up on your mobile phone. Download and install Viber for your mobile platform from the below links.

- [Google Play Store][5]

Once installed, set up Viber. Remember, it requires your mobile number to register.

After setting up, open the app on the Linux desktop. And you should see a screen like the one below.
