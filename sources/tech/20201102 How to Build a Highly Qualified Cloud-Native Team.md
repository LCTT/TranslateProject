How to Build a Highly Qualified Cloud-Native Team
======

If you’re reading this, you more than likely are aware of the struggles involved in recruiting and building a team of technical professionals skilled in cloud-native computing technologies such as Kubernetes, Helm, Prometheus, and service mesh. The Linux Foundation and edX’s “2020 Open Source Jobs Report” found 93% of hiring managers are having difficulties filling open positions that require open source skills like these. The report also found that cloud and container technologies are the most in-demand aside from Linux, which itself is a necessary basic skill for cloud professionals.

So the question is, between a talent shortage and rapidly increasing adoption of these technologies, how can any leader manage to build out a qualified team? Based on our experiences as a vendor-neutral provider of training and certification for many of these technologies, we’ve learned some tips and tricks that, with some effort, can help you establish a team that can handle any cloud-native project you throw at them.
