Cloud Native Training & Certification from The Linux Foundation & CNCF
======

There’s no question that cloud computing skills are in demand, and knowing cloud can help you secure a lucrative career. In fact, the [2020 Open Source Jobs Report][1] from The Linux Foundation and edX found that knowledge of cloud skills has the biggest impact on hiring decisions. LinkedIn also [named][2] cloud computing the second most in demand hard skill of 2020. And a recent [D2iQ study][3] found “only 23% of organizations believe they have the talent required to successfully complete their cloud native journey”. 

Closing this talent gap is why Linux Foundation Training &amp; Certification has partnered with the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) – the home of Kubernetes, Linkerd, Prometheus, Helm and other widely used cloud native technologies – on a variety of programs to make quality cloud native learning more accessible. The hope is that providing more educational opportunities will lead to a great ability for those aspiring to work in the field to do so.

This article examines the various training courses available to learn about cloud native technologies, as well as certification exams to demonstrate that knowledge. Sample learning paths are also included as a guide of how to get started, and how to proceed on the cloud native learning journey.

**Free Training Courses**

Our catalog of free cloud native courses is offered on the non-profit edX platform, and provides the fundamentals necessary to move on to more advanced training. These courses are all taken online and are self-paced. Note you can audit each course at no cost for between six and fourteen weeks depending on the course, so we recommend completing each course you are interested in before moving on to the next to ensure you do not run out of time.
