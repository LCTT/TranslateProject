COOLEST PRIVACY FOCUSED OPEN SOURCE CHAT APP WIRE COMES TO LINUX
===========

[![Open Source messaging app Wire comes to Linux](https://itsfoss.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/wire-on-desktop-linux.jpeg)][21]

Around two years back, a few people behind [Skype][20] launched a beautiful new messaging app, [Wire][19]. When I say beautiful, I am talking about the looks. Wire has an uncluttered, sleek look which many other messaging apps don’t have. But that’s not it’s best selling point.

Since the beginning, Wire marketed itself as the [world’s most private messaging app][18]. It offers end to end encryption to text and voice calls, graphics, images, basically every content you share.

WhatsApp also offers ‘end to end encryption’ but considering that its owner [Facebook is sharing WhatsApp data for ad targeting][17], I have less faith in WhatsApp and its encryption.

What makes Wire even more special for us FOSS lovers is that a few months back [Wire went open source][16]. Few months down the line and we have a beta version of Wire desktop application for Linux.

The desktop client is nothing more than a wrapper of its web version. Thank [open source project Electron][15] for providing a way to easily make cross-platform desktop applications. Many other applications have used Electron to bring a native desktop app for Linux, including [Skype][14].

### WIRE FEATURES:

Before we see more about the Linux version of Wire, let’s have a quick look at some of its main features.

*   Open source application
*   Complete encryption for all type of contents
*   No ads, no data gathering, no data sharing
*   Text, voice and video chats
*   Group chats and calls
*   [Audio filters][1] (no need to inhale Helium, just apply that filter and talk in a funny voice)
*   No phone numbers required, can be signed up with email
*   Sleek, modern interface
*   Cross platform messaging app with iOS, Android, Web, Mac, Windows and Linux clients
*   Protected by European laws (which are more privacy oriented that the US ones)

Wire has some seriously cool features up its sleeve, especially those audio filters akin to [Snapchat][13].

### INSTALL WIRE ON LINUX

Before you go on installing Wire on Linux, let me warn you that it is still in beta phase. So, if you encounter a few bugs, don’t get miffed.

Wire has a .deb client available for 64 bit systems. You can use these tips to find out if you got [32 bit or 64 bit system][12]. You can download the .deb file from the link below:

If you are interested, you can have a look at the source code also:

[Wire Desktop Source Code][10]

This is what the default interface of Wire look like in [elementary OS Loki][9]:

You see, they have even got bots here :)

Have you been already using Wire? If yes, how is your experience with it? If no, will you give it a try since it’s [open source][7] now and available for Linux?
