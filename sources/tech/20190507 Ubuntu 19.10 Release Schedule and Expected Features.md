Ubuntu 19.10 Release Schedule and Expected Features
======

_**This is a continually updated article to inform you about Ubuntu 19.10 release date, features and other important things associated with it.**_

[Ubuntu 19.04 Disco Dingo has been released][1] and it’s time to look towards the upcoming Ubuntu 19.10. The development for Ubuntu 19.10 has already started but there is little information available about the new features it will be bringing at the moment.

Ubuntu 19.10 is an important release because it will set the course of development for Ubuntu 20.04 LTS (long term support). I have always felt that the LTS version release takes a lot of features from its predecessor.

In other words, Ubuntu 19.10 will be a glimpse of the features you would be getting in Ubuntu 20.04.

### Ubuntu 19.10 Eoan Ermine release schedule

![][2]

Ubuntu 19.10 has been codenamed Eoan Ermine. My vocabulary is poor so I had to look up both the words in dictionary. Eoan means ‘relating to the dawn or the east’ and Eermine is a kind of [weasel][3]. You can read my earlier article to know the [logic behind these seemingly weird codenames][4].

Following a development cycle of 25 weeks, Ubuntu 19.10 will be released on 17th October 2019.

The complete release schedule of Ubuntu 19.10 is here:

  * Feature Freeze: August 22, 2019
  * Beta Release: September 26, 2019
  * Final Freeze: October 10, 2019
  * Final Release: October 17, 2019



### New features coming to Ubuntu 19.10

It’s too early to say exactly what new features Ubuntu 19.10 will be bringing but here are a few expected and confirmed changes you should be seeing in Eoan Ermine.

  * Performance and visual changes through GNOME 3.34
