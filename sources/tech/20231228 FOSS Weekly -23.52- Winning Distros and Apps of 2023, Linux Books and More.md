Did you notice the number 23.52? Yes, this is the 52nd newsletter of this year. That's happening for the second year in a row when I was able to send you the newsletter each week of the year. Something to be proud of, surely.

There are more achievements and statistics: It's FOSS websites have been visited over **35 million times in 2023**. We get most readers from US, UK, India, followed by Germany and Canada.

It's FOSS reached 100,000 followers on Twitter and 25,000 subscribers to the FOSS Weekly newsletter in 2023.

2024 will see some changes on It's FOSS. More tutorial series, some coverage on homelab and open source AI are on the roadmap, among other things. You should start seeing them by the end of January.
