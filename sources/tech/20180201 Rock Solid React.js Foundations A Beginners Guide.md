React.js crash course

I’ve been working with React and React-Native for the last couple of months. I have already released two apps in production, [Kiven Aa][1] (React) and [Pollen Chat][2] (React Native). When I started learning React, I was searching for something (a blog, a video, a course, whatever) that didn’t only teach me how to write apps in React. I also wanted it to prepare me for interviews.

Most of the material I found, concentrated on one or the other. So, this post is aimed towards the audience who is looking for a perfect mix of theory and hands-on. I will give you a little bit of theory so that you understand what is happening under the hood and then I will show you how to write some React.js code.

If you prefer video, I have this entire course up on YouTube as well. Please check that out.


Let’s dive in…

> React.js is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces

You can build all sorts of single page applications. For example, chat messengers and e-commerce portals where you want to show changes on the user interface in real-time.

### Everything’s a component

A React app is comprised of components,  _a lot of them_ , nested into one another.  _But what are components, you may ask?_ 

A component is a reusable piece of code, which defines how certain features should look and behave on the UI. For example, a button is a component.

Let’s look at the following calculator, which you see on Google when you try to calculate something like 2+2 = 4 –1 = 3 (quick maths!)

Red markers denote components

As you can see in the image above, the calculator has many areas — like the  _result display window_  and the  _numpad_ . All of these can be separate components or one giant component. It depends on how comfortable one is in breaking down and abstracting away things in React

You write code for all such components separately. Then combine those under one container, which in turn is a React component itself. This way you can create reusable components and your final app will be a collection of separate components working together.

The following is one such way you can write the calculator, shown above, in React.

```
<Calculator>
  <DisplayWindow />
  <NumPad>
    <Key number={1}/>
    <Key number={2}/>
    .
    .
    .
    <Key number={9}/>
  </NumPad>
</Calculator>

```

Yes! It looks like HTML code, but it isn’t. We will explore more about it in the later sections.

### Setting up our Playground

This tutorial focuses on React’s fundamentals. It is not primarily geared towards React for Web or [React Native][3] (for building mobile apps). So, we will use an online editor so as to avoid web or native specific configurations before even learning what React can do.

I’ve already set up an environment for you on [codepen.io][4]. Just follow the link and read all the comments in HTML and JavaScript (JS) tabs.

### Controlling Components

We’ve learned that a React app is a collection of various components, structured as a nested tree. Thus, we require some sort of mechanism to pass data from one component to other.

#### Enter “props”

We can pass arbitrary data to our component using a `props` object. Every component in React gets this `props` object.

Before learning how to use this `props` object, let’s learn about functional components.

#### a) Functional component

A functional component in React consumes arbitrary data that you pass to it using `props` object. It returns an object which describes what UI React should render. Functional components are also known as Stateless components.

Let’s write our first functional component.

```
function Hello(props) {
  return <div>{props.name}</div>
}
```

It’s that simple. We just passed `props` as an argument to a plain JavaScript function and returned,  _umm, well, what was that? That _  `_<div>{props.name}</div>_`  _thing!_  It’s JSX (JavaScript Extended). We will learn more about it in a later section.

This above function will render the following HTML in the browser.

```
 <!-- If the "props" object is: {name: 'rajat'} -->
<div>
  rajat
</div>
```


> Read the section below about JSX, where I have explained how did we get this HTML from our JSX code.

How can you use this functional component in your React app? Glad you asked! It’s as simple as the following.

```
<Hello name='rajat' age={26}/>
```

The attribute `name` in the above code becomes `props.name` inside our `Hello`component. The attribute `age` becomes `props.age` and so on.

> Remember! You can nest one React component inside other React components.

Let’s use this `Hello` component in our codepen playground. Replace the `div`inside `ReactDOM.render()` with our `Hello` component, as follows, and see the changes in the bottom window.

```
function Hello(props) {
  return <div>{props.name}</div>
}

ReactDOM.render(<Hello name="rajat"/>, document.getElementById('root'));
```


> But what if your component has some internal state. For instance, like the following counter component, which has an internal count variable, which changes on + and — key presses.

A React component with an internal state

#### b) Class-based component

The class-based component has an additional property `state` , which you can use to hold a component’s private data. We can rewrite our `Hello` component using class notation as follows. Since these components have a state, these are also known as Stateful components.

```
class Counter extends React.Component {
  // this method should be present in your component
  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        {this.props.name}
      </div>
    );
  }
}
```

We extend `React.Component` class of React library to make class-based components in React. Learn more about JavaScript classes [here][5].

The `render()` method must be present in your class as React looks for this method in order to know what UI it should render on screen.

To use this sort of internal state, we first have to initialize the `state` object in the constructor of the component class, in the following way.

```
class Counter extends React.Component {
  constructor() {
    super();
    
    // define the internal state of the component
    this.state = {name: 'rajat'}
  }
  
  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        {this.state.name}
      </div>
    );
  }
}

// Usage:
// In your react app: <Counter />
```

Similarly, the `props` can be accessed inside our class-based component using `this.props` object.

To set the state, you use `React.Component`'s `setState()`. We will see an example of this, in the last part of this tutorial.

> Tip: Never call `setState()` inside `render()` function, as `setState()` causes component to re-render and this will result in endless loop.


![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1000/1*rPUhERO1Bnr5XdyzEwNOwg.png)
A class-based component has an optional property “state”.

 _Apart from _  `_state_`  _, a class-based component has some life-cycle methods like _  `_componentWillMount()._`  _ These you can use to do stuff, like initializing the _  `_state_`  _and all but that is out of the scope of this post._ 

### JSX

JSX is a short form of  _JavaScript Extended_  and it is a way to write `React`components. Using JSX, you get the full power of JavaScript inside XML like tags.

You put JavaScript expressions inside `{}`. The following are some valid JSX examples.

 ```
 <button disabled={true}>Press me!</button>
 
 <button disabled={true}>Press me {3+1} times!</button>;
 
 <div className='container'><Hello /></div>
 
 ```

The way it works is you write JSX to describe what your UI should look like. A [transpiler][6] like `Babel` converts that code into a bunch of `React.createElement()` calls. The React library then uses those `React.createElement()` calls to construct a tree-like structure of DOM elements. In case of React for Web or Native views in case of React Native. It keeps it in the memory.

React then calculates how it can effectively mimic this tree in the memory of the UI displayed to the user. This process is known as [reconciliation][7]. After that calculation is done, React makes the changes to the actual UI on the screen.

How React converts your JSX into a tree which describes your app’s UI

You can use [Babel’s online REPL][8] to see what React actually outputs when you write some JSX.


![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1000/1*NRuBKgzNh1nHwXn0JKHafg.png)
Use Babel REPL to transform JSX into plain JavaScript

> Since JSX is just a syntactic sugar over plain `React.createElement()` calls, React can be used without JSX.

Now we have every concept in place, so we are well positioned to write a `counter` component that we saw earlier as a GIF.

The code is as follows and I hope that you already know how to render that in our playground.

```
class Counter extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    
    this.state = {count: this.props.start || 0}
    
    // the following bindings are necessary to make `this` work in the callback
    this.inc = this.inc.bind(this);
    this.dec = this.dec.bind(this);
  }
  
  inc() {
    this.setState({
      count: this.state.count + 1
    });
  }
  
  dec() {
    this.setState({
      count: this.state.count - 1
    });
  }
  
  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <button onClick={this.inc}>+</button>
        <button onClick={this.dec}>-</button>
        <div>{this.state.count}</div>
      </div>
    );
  }
}
```

The following are some salient points about the above code.

1.  JSX uses `camelCasing` hence `button`'s attribute is `onClick`, not `onclick`, as we use in HTML.

2.  Binding is necessary for `this` to work on callbacks. See line #8 and 9 in the code above.

The final interactive code is located [here][9].

With that, we’ve reached the conclusion of our React crash course. I hope I have shed some light on how React works and how you can use React to build bigger apps, using smaller and reusable components.
