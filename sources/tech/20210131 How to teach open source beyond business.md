How to teach open source beyond business
======
商业之上是开源

The Beyond program connects future talents in the tech industry with
open source culture.
The Beyond Program 连接起未来科技行业拥抱开源文化的人才。

![Teacher or learner?][1]

When I was a university student, I didn't understand the fuss about open source software. I used Linux and open source software but didn't really understand the open source model, how to contribute to projects, or how it could benefit my future career. My development experience consisted mainly of homework assignments and a large final project required for my degree.
那时，我还是一个大学生，我不明白人们为什么那么吹捧开源软件。我也使用 Linux 和开源软件，但是我不明白开源的模式，如何参加一个开源项目，并且它是如何影响我点职业生涯的。我的开发经验主要是家庭作业和学位需要的一个大型项目。

So, when I took my first steps in the tech industry, there was a big learning curve before I felt comfortable. I needed to understand how to join established, sometimes large, and distributed teams working on an ongoing project. I also needed to know how to communicate properly so that my efforts could be recognized.
所以，当我开始踏足科技行业时，我发现我还有很多知识需要学习。我需要明白如何加入一个正在进行中的项目，可能团队很大，并且分散在不同地方。我还要学会正确的沟通以保证我付出点努力不白费。

I am not special in this regard. This is a common situation among new graduates.
我在这个行业并不特殊。我只是众多毕业生中的一员。

### Open source gives students a head start
### 开源让毕业生点起点更高

Since then, as an engineer and later as a manager, I have helped onboard many junior engineers. One of the things I've noticed is that the new graduates who have already contributed to open source projects could onboard quickly and start contributing faster than those without this experience.
作为一个工程师，一个管理者，从那时起我开始帮助刚入行的工程师。我发现，有开源经验的毕业生比没有开源经验的毕业生能更快的入门。

By incorporating open source methodology into academic studies, students can gain experience relevant to the industry, learn to reuse their existing knowledge, and establish a good platform for formulating ideas and sharing knowledge. Practicing open source can make a positive impact on students' technical knowledge and experience. This can help them become more successful in bootstrapping their careers.
通过将开源方法纳入学术研究，学生们可以获得相关的行业经验，学会复用他们自己的知识，并建立一个陈述观点和分享知识的平台。

The value of open source methodologies in the tech industry is well-established and shapes the culture of software companies worldwide. Involvement in open source projects and adoption of the [open organization culture][2] has become an industry standard. Companies seek fresh-minded, talented employees who know how to work in open source and cultivate its culture. Therefore, the tech industry must drive the academic world to embrace open source culture as one of the fundamental methodologies to learn in tech studies.
开源在科技行业的价值是塑造并完善全球软件公司的文化。参与开源项目并采用[开放组织文化][2]正在成为行业普遍现象。公司寻求知道如何在开源领域工作并培养其文化的思想新颖，才华横溢的员工。
因此，科技行业必须推动学术界将开源文化作为学习科技研究的基本方法之一。

### Moving open source culture 'Beyond' business
### 商业之上是开源文化

When I met [Liora Milbaum][3], a senior principal software engineer at Red Hat, I learned we shared an interest in bringing open source culture and principles into academics. Liora had previously founded [DevOps Loft][4], in which she shared DevOps practices with people interested in stepping into this world, and wished to start a similar initiative to teach open source to university students. We decided to launch the [Beyond][5] program to connect future talents in the tech industry with open source culture as Red Hat practices it.
当我遇到红帽的高级软件工程师 [Liora Milbaum][3] 时，我发现，我们对将开源文化和规则引入学术界有着共同的兴趣。Liora 之前创立了 [DevOps Loft][4], 在其中，她与有兴趣进入这个行业的人们分享了 DevOps 实践，并希望发起一个类似的项目，向大学生教授开源。我们决定启动 [Beyond][5] program，将科技行业拥抱开源精神的人才与红帽的实践联系起来。

We started the Beyond program at the [Academic College of Tel Aviv-Yafo][6], where we were warmly welcomed by the information systems faculty. We started by teaching an "Introduction to DevOps'' course to introduce elements of the DevOps tech stack. Our biggest challenge at the start was deciding how to teach what open source is. The answer was simple: by practicing it, of course. We didn't want to deliver yet another old-school academic course; rather, we wanted to expose students to industry standards.
我们在 [Academic College of Tel Aviv-Yafo][6] 开始了 Beyond program ，在那里，我们受到了信息系统学院的热烈欢迎。我们从介绍 DevOps 技术栈的“DevOps入门”开始。我们开始时最大的挑战是怎么讲明白开源是什么。答案似乎很简单：实践出真理。我们不想给学生们讲授什么老套的学院课程，而是向学生们展示了一套工业标准。

We created a syllabus that incorporated common open source projects and tools to teach the DevOps stack. The course consisted of lectures and hands-on participation taught by engineers. The students were divided into groups, each one mentored and supported by an engineer. They practiced working in teams, sharing knowledge (both inside and outside of their groups), and collaborating effectively.
我们创建了一个包含常见的开源项目和工具的教学大纲来教授 DevOps 技术栈。该课程由工程师教授的讲座和实践组成。学生们被分成小组，每组都由一名工程师指导和支持。他们练习团队合作，分享知识（在团队内外），并有效的协作。

During our second course, "Open source development pillars," for students in the computer science department, we encountered another big obstacle. Two weeks after the course started, we became fully remote as the COVID pandemic hit the globe. We solved this problem by using the same remote collaboration tools with our students that we were using for our daily work at Red Hat. We were amazed at how simple and smooth the transition was.

### Successful early outcomes
### 成果展示

The two courses were a huge success, and we even hired one of the top students we taught. The feedback we received was amazing; the students said we positively impacted their knowledge, thinking, and soft skills. A few students were hired for their first tech job based on their open source contributions during the course.

Other academic institutions have expressed interest in adopting these courses, so we've expanded the program to another university.

I am fortunate to co-lead this successful initiative with Liora, accompanied by a team of talented engineers. Together, we are helping increase the open source community a bit more.
