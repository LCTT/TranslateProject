## 💡 Quick handy tip

![][14]

Want to trigger a click when you hover the pointer over something? You can do that through the Click Assist feature.

From _Settings_ ➝ _Accessibility_ , Turn On _Click Assist_. Next, as shown in the screenshot above, enable the “ _Hover Click_ ” button. You can also adjust the time it takes to click after hover.

This will activate a mouse cursor button on the top panel. Click on it and select an action you want, when you hover over an item, it performs the assigned action.

Options include double click, right click, drag, and secondary click.
