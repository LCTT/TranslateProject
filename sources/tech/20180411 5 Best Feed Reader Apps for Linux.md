5 Best Feed Reader Apps for Linux
======

**Brief: Extensively use RSS feeds to stay updated with your favorite websites? Take a look at the best feed reader applications for Linux.**

[RSS][1] feeds were once most widely used, to collect news and articles from different sources at one place. It is often perceived that [RSS usage is in decline][2]. However, there are still people (like me) who believe in opening an application that accumulates all the website’s articles at one place, which they can read later even when they are not connected to the internet.

Feed Readers makes it easier by collecting all the published items on a website for anytime access. You don’t need to open several browser tabs to go to your favorite websites, and bookmarking the one you liked.

In this article, I’ll share some of my favorite feed reader applications for Linux desktop.

### Best Feed Readers for Linux

[Newsbeuter][12] is an open source feed reader for terminal lovers. There is an option to add and delete an RSS feed and to get the content on the terminal itself. Newsbeuter is loved by people who spend more time on the terminal and want their feed to be clutter free from images and ads.

You can get the useful commands at the bottom of the terminal which can help you in using newsbeuter. You can read this [manual page][14] for detailed information.

#### Final Words

To me, feed readers are still relevant, especially when you follow multiple websites and blogs. The offline access to your favorite website and blog’s content with options to archive and search is the biggest advantage of using a feed reader.

Do you use a feed reader on your Linux system? If yes, tell us your favorite one in the comments.
