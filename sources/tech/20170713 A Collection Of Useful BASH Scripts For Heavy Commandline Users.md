### Bash-Snippets – A Collection Of Useful BASH Scripts For Heavy Commandline Users

#### Installation

You can install these scripts on any OS that supports BASH.

First, clone the GIT repository using command:
```
$ git clone https://github.com/alexanderepstein/Bash-Snippets

```

Go to the cloned directory:
```
$ cd Bash-Snippets/

```

Git checkout to the latest stable release:
```
$ git checkout v1.22.0

```

Finally, install the Bash-Snippets using command:
```
$ sudo ./install.sh

```

This will ask you which scripts to install. Just type **Y** and press ENTER key to install the respective script. If you don’t want to install a particular script, type **N** and hit ENTER.
```
Do you wish to install currency [Y/n]: y

```

To install all scripts, run:
```
$ sudo ./install.sh all

```

To install a specific script, say currency, run:
```
$ sudo ./install.sh currency

```

You can also install it using [**Linuxbrew**][1] package manager.

To installs all tools, run:
```
$ brew install bash-snippets

```

To install specific tools:
```
$ brew install bash-snippets --without-all-tools --with-newton --with-weather

```

Also, there is a PPA for Debian-based systems such as Ubuntu, Linux Mint.
```
$ sudo add-apt-repository ppa:navanchauhan/bash-snippets
$ sudo apt update
$ sudo apt install bash-snippets

```

#### Usage

**An active Internet connection is required** to use these tools. The usage is fairly simple. Let us see how to use some of these scripts. I assume you have installed all scripts.

**1\. Currency – Currency Converter**

This script converts the currency based on realtime exchange rates. Enter the base currency code and the currency to exchange to, and the amount being exchanged one by one as shown below.
```
$ currency
What is the base currency: INR
What currency to exchange to: USD
What is the amount being exchanged: 10

=========================
| INR to USD
| Rate: 0.015495
| INR: 10
| USD: .154950
=========================

```

You can also pass all arguments in a single command as shown below.
```
$ currency INR USD 10

```

Refer the following screenshot.

**2\. Stocks – Display stock price details**

If you want to check a stock price details, mention the stock item as shown below.
```
$ stocks Intel

INTC stock info
=============================================
| Exchange Name: NASDAQ
| Latest Price: 34.2500
| Close (Previous Trading Day): 34.2500
| Price Change: 0.0000
| Price Change Percentage: 0.00%
| Last Updated: Jul 12, 4:00PM EDT
=============================================

```

The above output the **Intel stock** details.

**3\. Weather – Display Weather details**

Let us check the Weather details by running the following command:
```
$ weather

```

**Sample output:**

![][4]

As you see in the above screenshot, it provides the 3 day weather forecast. Without any arguments, it will display the weather details based on your IP address. You can also bring the weather details of a particular city or country like below.
```

```

Also, you can view the moon phase by entering the following command:

**4\. Crypt – Encrypt and Decrypt files**

This script is a wrapper for openssl that allows you to encrypt and decrypt files quickly and easily.

To encrypt a file, use the following command:
```
$ crypt -e [original file] [encrypted file]

```

For example, the following command will encrypt a file called **ostechnix.txt** , and save it as **encrypt_ostechnix.txt **in the current working directory.
```
$ crypt -e ostechnix.txt encrypt_ostechnix.txt

```

Enter the password for the file twice.
```
Encrypting ostechnix.txt...
enter aes-256-cbc encryption password:
Verifying - enter aes-256-cbc encryption password:
Successfully encrypted

```

The above command will encrypt the given file using **AES 256 level encryption**. The password will not be saved in plain text. You can encrypt .pdf, .txt, .docx, .doc, .png, .jpeg type files.

To decrypt the file, use the following command:
```
$ crypt -d [encrypted file] [output file]

```

Example:
```
$ crypt -d encrypt_ostechnix.txt ostechnix.txt

```

Enter the password to decrypt.
```
Decrypting encrypt_ostechnix.txt...
enter aes-256-cbc decryption password:
Successfully decrypted

```

**5\. Movies – Find Movie details**

Using this script, you can find a movie details.

The following command displays the details of a movie called “mother”.

```

To clear all tasks, run:
```
$ todo -c
Tasks cleared.

```
