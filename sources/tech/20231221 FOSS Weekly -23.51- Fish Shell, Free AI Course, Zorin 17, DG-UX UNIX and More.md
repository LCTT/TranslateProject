## 💡 Quick handy tip

![][15]

You can prevent entering characters accidentally on a running GNOME terminal session by making it read-only.

To do this, click on the top-right hamburger menu and check the option called “ _Read-Only_ ”.

It can also be done by right-clicking on a terminal window and selecting “ _Read-Only”_

Revert the same process to resume input of characters.
