New Mobile Native Foundation to Foster Development Collaboration
======

_Linux Foundation hosts effort to improve processes and technologies for large-scale mobile Android and iOS applications; Lyft makes initial contributions_

**SAN FRANCISCO, Calif., March 2, 2021** – The Linux Foundation, the nonprofit organization enabling mass innovation through open source, today announced the Mobile Native Foundation (MNF). The MNF will bring developers together to improve processes and technologies that support large-scale Android and iOS applications. Organizations contributing to this effort include Airbnb, Capital One, Corellium, Elotl, Flare.build, GitHub, GogoApps, Haystack, Line, LinkedIn, Lyft, Microsoft, Peloton, Robinhood, Sauce Labs, Screenplay.dev, Slack, Solid Software, Spotify, Square and Uber.

“Like many of our industry peers, Lyft discovered that platform vendors did not solve all of the problems we faced as our mobile team grew from a dozen engineers to hundreds of active contributors,” said Keith Smiley, Staff Engineer, Lyft. “The Mobile Native Foundation will foster a diverse community that encourages collaboration and builds libraries and tools to move the industry forward.”

The MNF is a forum for collaboration on open source software, standards and best practices that can result in common UI frameworks, architectural patterns, build systems and networking stacks that can accelerate time to market and reduce duplicative work across companies.

“The mobile developer community is innovating and we know that open source and collaboration can ensure that continues,” said Mike Dolan, executive vice president and GM of Projects at the Linux Foundation. “The MNF will accelerate and smooth mobile app development and brings new contributions to the Linux Foundation ecosystem.”

Lyft is making early project contributions to the MNF that includes [Kronos][1], [index-import][2] and [set-simulator-location][3]. Matthew Edwards is also contributing [Flank][4].
