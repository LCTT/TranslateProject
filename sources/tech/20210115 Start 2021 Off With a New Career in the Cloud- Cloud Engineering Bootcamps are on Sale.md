Start 2021 Off With a New Career in the Cloud! Cloud Engineering Bootcamps are on Sale
======

The [2020 Open Source Jobs Report][1] found that cloud skills are the most in demand by hiring managers, with 70% reporting they are more likely to hire someone with a solid foundation in cloud and container technologies. Additionally, a [D2iQ study][2] found that “only 23% of organizations believe they have the talent required to successfully complete their cloud native journey”. If you’re looking to move to a new career this year, gaining cloud skills and knowledge is the place to start, and now is the time to make it happen.

Last summer, The Linux Foundation and Cloud Native Computing Foundation launched our first ever bootcamp programs to help individuals become trained and certified in cloud technologies in a structured, supported way. The Cloud Engineer Bootcamp and Advanced Cloud Engineer Bootcamp contain the training courses and exams to get you prepared with the knowledge and skills to succeed in a career as a cloud administrator or engineer in as little as six months, and the verifiable, industry-leading certifications to demonstrate those skills. 

The Cloud Engineer Bootcamp is designed for relative newbies, who want to start an IT career with little or no prior experience. As cloud technologies are underpinned by Linux, the program starts with two courses giving you the Linux skills you need to get started, and the Linux Foundation Certified System Administrator (LFCS) exam to help you prove it. The program then continues with three courses focused on cloud and container technologies, finishing with the highly-sought Certified Kubernetes Administrator (CKA) exam.

The Advanced Cloud Engineer Bootcamp assumes you already possess the requisite Linux knowledge to make a start with learning about cloud technologies, so jumps right in with two cloud and containers courses and the CKA exam. This bootcamp then moves into more advanced cloud concepts and technologies, including service mesh, monitoring, logging and application management, in four additional courses. 

Both bootcamps include office hours with live instructors daily via Zoom, giving you the opportunity to ask questions and get help understanding the course material. There are also bootcamp forums, providing the chance to interact with fellow enrollees and discuss lessons and topics. Upon completion, you will receive a verifiable, digital badge for completing the bootcamp, as well as badges for passing each certification exam.

Through January 19, both bootcamps are reduced in price from their usual price of $999 (already a substantial discount from the $2,300 list price of the bootcamp components) to only $599. Those wishing to take both bootcamps can choose that option for only $899. Take advantage of this [limited time offer][3] to propel yourself into a new, highly lucrative career in 2021!
