Best Web Browsers for Ubuntu and Other Linux Distributions
======

There is no such thing as the perfect web browser. It all depends on what you prefer and what you use it for.

But, what are your best options when it comes to web browsers for Linux?

In this article, I try to highlight the best web browsers that you can pick for Ubuntu and other Linux.

**Note:** We have tried and tested these browsers on Ubuntu. But, you should be able to install it on any Linux distribution of your choice.

### Top Web Browsers for Linux

![Illustration for web browser running in Ubuntu Linux][1]

Every browser offers something unique. And, when it comes to the Linux platform, there are some interesting exclusive choices as well.

_**Before you see this list, please note that it is not a ranking list. The browser listed at number 1 should not be considered better than the ones at 2, 3 or 10.**_

Non-FOSS alert!

Some applications mentioned here are not open source. They are listed here because they are available on Linux and the article’s focus is on Linux. We have a separate [dedicated list of open source web browsers][2] as well.

### 1\. Vivaldi

![][3]

**Pros**

  * Sidebar for quick web application access
  * Calendar and Email integration
  * Unique tab management
  * Pomodoro feature
  * Mobile app available



**Cons**

  * Resource-heavy when using a variety of features
  * Not 100% open-source



Vivaldi is an impressive browser that has been getting more attention from Linux users more than ever.

While it is not 100% open-source, you can find most of its source code (except for its UI) online.

With [Vivaldi 4.0 release][4], they have been focusing more on improving the experience for Linux users. You can set clock timers to increase your work productivity, use the built-in translation for web pages, track your calendar, add shortcuts to web applications, and multi-task at its peak with this browser.

Even though it is a fast web browser, I wouldn’t bet on it as the “fastest” or lightest. You need a good amount of memory (RAM) to make use of all the features while you work on stuff.

Overall, it is a feature-rich web browser. So, if you need something with as many as features possible to multi-task, Vivaldi can be your choice.

[Vivaldi][5]

#### How to Install Vivaldi on Linux?

Vivaldi offers both **.deb** and **.rpm** packages to let you directly install it in your Linux system.

You can refer to our resources to [install Deb files][6] and [install RPM files][7] in case you are new to Linux.

### 2\. Mozilla Firefox

![][8]

**Pros**

  * Privacy protection
  * Not based on Chrome engine
  * Open Source
  * Firefox Account services



**Cons**

  * User Experience changes with major updates



Firefox is the default web browser for most Linux distributions. Hence, it is an obvious choice to start with.

In addition to being open-source, it offers some of the best privacy protection features. And, with the right settings, you can turn it into one of the most secure browsers similar to Tor Browser (which is also based on Firefox).

Not just limited to its security, but Firefox also offers useful integrated features like Pocket (to save web pages and read later), VPN, email alias, breach monitor, and more when you sign in with your Firefox account.

[Firefox][9]

#### How to Install Firefox on Linux?

It should already come pre-installed in your Linux distribution. But, if it is not present, you can search for it in the software center or install it using the terminal with the following command:

```
sudo apt install firefox
```

### 3\. Chromium

![][10]

**Pros**

  * Open Source Chrome alternative
  * Similar features to Google Chrome



**Cons**

  * Lacks certain features that Google Chrome offers



Chromium is the open-source alternative and the base for Google Chrome and many other chrome-based browsers.

If you do not want to use Google Chrome, chromium’s your best bet to get the same experience on Linux.

Even though Google controls Chromium and [has been locking down Chrome][11], it is a good option for Linux systems.

[Chromium][12]

#### How to Install Chromium on Linux?

You should be able to find it easily in the software center. But, if you need help, refer to our [installation guide for Chromium][13].

### 4\. Google Chrome

![][14]

**Pros**

  * Seamless integration with Google services



**Cons**

  * Not open-source



Google Chrome is an excellent web browser unless you do not want to opt for a proprietary solution or products by Google.

You get all the essential features and the ability to integrate all Google services. If you prefer using Google Chrome on Android and want to sync across multiple platforms, it is an obvious choice for desktop Linux.

If you were looking for a simple and capable web browser while using Google services, Google Chrome can be a great pick.

[Google Chrome][15]

#### How to Install Google Chrome on Linux?

Google Chrome offers both Deb and RPM packages to let you install on any Ubuntu-based or Fedora/openSUSE distribution.

If you need help with the installation, I should point you to our guide on [installing Google Chrome on Linux][16].

### 5\. Brave Browser

![][17]

**Pros**

  * Privacy protection features
  * Performance



**Cons**

  * No account-based sync



Brrave browser is one of the most popular Linux browsers.

It is an open-source project and is based on chromium. It offers several useful privacy protection features and is known for its blazing fast performance.

Unlike any other browsers, you can get rewards even if you block advertisements on websites. The rewards you collect can only be used to give back to your favorite websites. This way, you get to block ads and also support the website.

You can expect a faster user experience with minimum resource usage.  

We also have a detailed [comparison article on Brave vs Firefox][18], if you need to decide between the two.

Brave

#### How to Install Brave on Linux?

Unlike some other web browsers, you cannot directly find a package or in the software center. You need to enter some commands in the terminal to install the browser.

Fret not, you can follow our [instructions to install brave browser][19] to proceed.

### 6\. Opera

![][20]

**Pros**

  * Free VPN in-built
  * Extra features



**Cons**

  * Not open source



While Opera is not the most popular choice, it is definitely a useful browser for Linux users.

It comes with a built-in VPN and adblocker. So, you should have the basic privacy protection sorted with the help of the Opera web browser.

You can quickly access popular chat messengers right from the sidebar without needing to launch a separate app or window. This is similar to Vivaldi considering the side chat messenger web apps but the user experience is significantly different.

Overall, it is a good pick if you want a free VPN as an added bonus to other essential browsing features.

It is worth noting that Opera offers a unique [Opera GX][21] browser which lets you tweak/enforce limit on system resources when using a browser along with gaming activities. This was still in development for Linux at the time of writing, if it is available by the time you read it, that could be a fantastic option!

[Opera][22]

#### How to Install Opera?

Opera provides Deb package for Linux. You just head to its official website to download and install it.

### 7\. Microsoft Edge

![][23]

**Pros**

  * Convenient option for Windows users who also use Linux



**Cons**

  * Not open-source
  * Still in Beta



Microsoft Edge has surpassed Mozilla Firefox in terms of its popularity. Not just because it’s the default Windows browser, but it also offers a promising web experience while based on Chrome.

At the time of writing this article, Microsoft Edge is available as a beta release for Linux. It works fine at the moment, but lacks quite a few features normally available for Windows.

Overall, you should find most of the essential features available.

If you use Windows and Linux as your desktop platforms, Microsoft Edge can come in handy as the preferred web browser.

[Microsoft Edge][24]

#### How to install Microsoft Edge on Linux?

It is currently available through Microsoft Insiders channel as a beta. So, this could change once the stable release is out.

For now, you can get the Deb/RPM file through the Microsoft Edge insiders web page and install it.

You can also have a look at our how-to article on [installing Microsoft Edge on Linux][25].

### Unique Web Browsers for Linux

Most of the users prefer to stick with the mainstream options because of security updates and future upgrades, but there are some different options as well. And, some exclusive to Linux users.

### 8\. GNOME Web or Epiphany

![][26]

**Pros**

  * Minimal
  * Open Source



**Cons**

  * Lacks many features
  * No cross-platform support



Epiphany browser is the default GNOME browser. elementary OS utilizes it as its default web browser.

It is a minimal browser that offers a clean and elegant user experience. You cannot sync your bookmarks or history, so you need to manually export them if you want to back them up or transfer to another browser.

[GNOME Web][27]

#### How to Install GNOME Web?

You may find it pre-installed in some Linux distros. If not, you can check out its [Flatpak package][28] to install the latest version on any Linux distro.

### 9\. Falkon

![][29]

**Pros**

  * Firefox-based alternative



**Cons**

  * Not a replacement to Firefox
  * No cross-platform support



Falkon is a Firefox-based browser with privacy in mind. It should be good enough for basic web browsing, but it may not be a solution for your daily driver.

You can explore more about it and get the installation instructions in our dedicated [article on Falkon browser][30].

[Falkon][31]

### 10\. Nyxt

![][32]

**Pros**

  * Highly customizable
  * Keyboard use focused



**Cons**

  * Suitable for certain users
  * Lack of cross-platform support



Nyxt is an interesting web browser built for power keyboard users. You can browse and navigate the web using keyboard shortcuts.

To know more about it and the installation instructions, go through our detailed article on [Nyxt browser][33].

### Wrapping Up

When it comes to Linux, you get a variety of choices available to pick. I have deliberately skipped [command line based web browsers like Lynx][34] here.

So, what would be your selection for the best web browser?

Moreover, I’d be curious to know what do you look for when installing a web browser for your system?
