Wordsmith on the Linux command line with dict
======

As a writer, I frequently need to determine the correct spelling or definition of words. I also need to use a thesaurus to find alternate words that may have a somewhat different connotation than the one I might otherwise use. Because I frequently use the Linux command line and text-mode tools to do much of my work, it makes sense to use a command line dictionary.

I really like using the command line for a number of reasons, the primary one being that it is more efficient for me. It is also far more comprehensive than any one or multiple physical paper dictionaries, could ever be. I have been using the Linux `dict` command for many years and I have come to depend on it.

### Install dict on Linux

The dict program is not installed by default on Fedora, but it's easy to install. Here is how to install it on Fedora and similar programs:

```
$ sudo dnf install dictd
```

On Debian and similar programs, you must also install the dictionary definitions:

```
$ sudo apt install dictd dict-gcide
```

No additional configuration is required. The minimalistic `/usr/share/doc/dictd/dict1.conf` file specifies the remote server for the dictionary databases. This tool uses the Dictionary Server Protocol (DICT) on port 2628.

### Use dict on Linux

In a terminal session as a non-root user, type `dict <word>` to get a list of definitions from one or more dictionaries and the thesaurus. For example, look up the word `memory` this way.

```
$ dict memory | less
6 definitions found

  Memory \Mem"o*ry\, n.; pl. {Memories}. [OE. memorie, OF.
     memoire, memorie, F. m['e]moire, L. memoria, fr. memor
     mindful; cf. mora delay. Cf. {Demur}, {Martyr}, {Memoir},
     {Remember}.]
     [1913 Webster]
     1. The faculty of the mind by which it retains the knowledge
        of previous thoughts, impressions, or events.

              Memory is the purveyor of reason.     --Rambler.
        [1913 Webster]

     2. The reach and positiveness with which a person can
        remember; the strength and trustworthiness of one's power
        to reach and represent or to recall the past; as, his
        memory was never wrong.

  memory
      n 1: something that is remembered; "search as he would, the
           memory was lost"
      2: the cognitive processes whereby past experience is
         remembered; "he can do it from memory"; "he enjoyed
         remembering his father" [syn: {memory}, {remembering}]

From The Free On-line Dictionary of Computing (30 December 2018) [foldoc]:

  memory

     <storage> These days, usually used synonymously with {Random
     Access Memory} or {Read-Only Memory}, but in the general sense
     it can be any device that can hold {data} in

I have cut large sections of this result to save space while leaving enough information to provide an idea of what typical results look like. You can also look up multi-word phrases by enclosing them in quotes, either double or single.

```
$ dict "air gapped"
```

### Dictionaries

The `dict` command uses several online dictionaries, including legal and technical ones. Dictionaries are also available for many languages. You can `list` the available dictionary databases as shown here:

```
$ dict -D | less

You can specify individual dictionaries with the `-d` option:

```
$ dict -d gcide
```

### Endmost Dictum

Sometimes using words found in the thesaurus is not the best approach to writing as it can obfuscate your meaning. But I do find that the `dict` command can be immensely useful in choosing the best word for a specific meaning. It also ensures that the words I use are spelled correctly.

There's a dearth of information about dict. The URL [http://www.dict.org/][1] provides only a web-based interface to the dictionaries. The man page covers syntax. But the command is a useful and fun command to have handy. I admit that after discovering the `dict` command I spent many hours of the day just trying different things to see what the result would be. I was the kid who read the encyclopedia and dictionary. Yes, I was _that_ kid. In addition to being a useful tool when writing or reading, dict can also be a fun tool to satisfy a bit of curiosity.
