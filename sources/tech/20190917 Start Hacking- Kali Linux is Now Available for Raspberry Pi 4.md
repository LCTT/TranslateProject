Start Hacking! Kali Linux is Now Available for Raspberry Pi 4
======

We’ve already discussed how amazing the [Raspberry Pi 4][1] is with upgraded specs. You can easily utilize it as a desktop replacement for minimal tasks like browsing activities, managing media or similar stuff acting as a desktop replacement. In either case, IoT projects and so on.

That’s all good. But, we’re talking about something more exciting – which you might have already figured out from the headline.

[Offensive Security][2] announced to [officially support Kali Linux][3] on Raspberry Pi 4. Well, it was quite expected because of Raspberry Pi 4’s popularity just after a few weeks of launch.

### Raspberry Pi 4 and Kali Linux

![Kali Linux on Raspberry Pi 4][4]

If [you have read our Kali Linux review][5], you know that Kali Linux should not be used as a regular Linux desktop. It’s a [Linux distribution specifically crafted for cyber security professionals][6].

Fret not, you will still get the full-fledged Kali Linux that you have used on your desktop in some point of time. However, along with that, you also get an on-board WiFi monitor mode and [frame injection][7] support.

So, if you are an ethical hacker or learning to be one of the professionals, you can now just grab a Raspberry Pi 4 for $35 and install Kali Linux to get started.

You don’t need a lot of investment to learn the essentials. There is this free eBook from Kali Linux developers. I would also recommend Linux Basics for Hackers book that teaches you the basics of Linux with focus on networking and the book is written around Kali Linux.

### Downloading &amp; Installing Kali Linux on Raspberry Pi 4

For now, Kali Linux supports 32-bit – but we can expect 64-bit support in the near future (as they mentioned in their [announcement post][3]).

You can start downloading Kali Linux for Raspberry Pi 4 on Offensive Security’s ARM image downloads page.

[Download Kali Linux for Raspberry Pi][12]

You just need to scroll down to find the Raspberry Foundation section and then download the image file via Torrent. For installation, you should refer the [official documentation for Raspberry Pi][13].
