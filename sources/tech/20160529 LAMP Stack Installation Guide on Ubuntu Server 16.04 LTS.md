LAMP Stack Installation Guide on Ubuntu Server 16.04 LTS
=========================================================

LAMP stack is a collection of free and open source softwares like **Linux**, Web Server (**Apache**), Database server (**MySQL / MariaDB**) and **PHP** (Scripting Language). LAMP is the platform which is required to install and build dynamic web sites and application like WordPress, Joomla, OpenCart and Drupal.

In this article i will describe how to install LAMP on Ubuntu Server 16.04 LTS, As We know that Ubuntu is a Linux based Operating system, so it provides the first component of LAMP and i am assuming Ubuntu Server 16.04 is already installed on your system.

### Installation of Web Server (Apache2) :

In Ubuntu Linux Web server comes with the name Apache2, Use the beneath apt command to install it.

```
linuxtechi@ubuntu:~$ sudo apt update
linuxtechi@ubuntu:~$ sudo apt install apache2 -y
```

When Apache2 package is installed then its service is automatically started and enabled across the reboot, In case it is not started and enabled, use the following command :

```
linuxtechi@ubuntu:~$ sudo systemctl start apache2.service
linuxtechi@ubuntu:~$ sudo systemctl enable apache2.service
linuxtechi@ubuntu:~$ sudo systemctl status apache2.service
```

If Ubuntu firewall (ufw) is active, then allow the Web Server ports (80 and 443) in firewall using below commands.

```
linuxtechi@ubuntu:~$ sudo ufw status
Status: active
linuxtechi@ubuntu:~$ sudo ufw allow in 'Apache Full'
Rule added
Rule added (v6)
linuxtechi@ubuntu:~$
```

### Access Web Server now :

Open the Web browser and type the IP Address or Host name of your server (http://IP_Address_OR_Host_Name), In my Case my server IP is ‘192.168.1.13’
