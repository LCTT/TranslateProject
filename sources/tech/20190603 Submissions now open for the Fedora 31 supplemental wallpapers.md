Submissions now open for the Fedora 31 supplemental wallpapers
======

![][1]

Have you always wanted to start contributing to Fedora but don’t know how? Submitting a supplemental wallpaper is one of the easiest ways to start as a Fedora contributor. Keep reading to learn how.

Each release, the Fedora [Design team][2] works with the community on a set of 16 additional wallpapers. Users can install and use these to supplement the standard wallpaper. And submissions are now open for the Fedora 31 Supplemental Wallpapers.

### Dates and deadlines

The submission phase opens **June 3, 2019** and ends **July 26, 2019 at 23:59 UTC**.

**Important note:** In certain circumstances, submissions during the last hours may not get into the election, if there is no time to do legal research. The legal research is done by hand and very time consuming. Please help by **following the guidelines correctly** and submit only work that has a correct license.

Please stay away to submit pictures of pets, especially cats.

The voting will open **August 1, 2019** and will be open until **August 16, 2019 at 23:59 UTC.**

### How to contribute to this package

Fedora uses the [Nuancier][3] application to manage the submissions and the voting process. To submit, you need an Fedora account. If you don’t have one, [you can create one here][4]. To vote you must have membership in another group such as _cla_done_ or _cla_fpca_.

For inspiration you can look to former submissions and the [previous winners][5]. Here are some from the last election:

  * ![Pink House by Everaldo Coelho][6]

  * ![Blue Mystic by Clyde He][7]

  * ![Canadian Rockies by Helena Bartosova][8]

  * ![Mushroom Family by ahalman][9]

  * ![Mountains of North Iran by ahalman][10]

  * ![Wheat by psav][11]

  * ![Sunset on Skye by noe38330][12]

  * ![Zen Lover by hhlp][13]

  * ![Snow on Balanced Rock by n8inup][14]

  * ![Wasser im Winter by Alexander Hanauer][15]

  * ![Dortmund Sunset by Hendrik Borghorst][16]

  * ![I see stars by haven1][17]

  * ![Enjoying the Sun by lhirlimann][18]

  * ![Lonely tree in kenya by lhirlimann][19]

  * ![Great Oak in Claremont by n8inup][20]

  * ![Fabric by Hendrik Borghorst][21]




You may only upload **two submissions** into Nuancier. In case you submit multiple versions of the same image, the team will choose one version of it and accept it as one submission, and deny the other one.

Previously submissions that were not selected should not be resubmitted, and may be rejected. Creations that lack essential artistic quality may also be rejected.

Denied submissions into Nuancier count. Therefore, if you make two submissions and both are rejected, you cannot submit more. Use your best judgment for your submissions.

### Badges

You can also earn badges for contributing. One badge is for an accepted submission. Another badge is awarded if your submission is a chosen wallpaper. A third is awarded if you participate in the voting process. You must claim this badge during the voting process, as it is not granted automatically.
