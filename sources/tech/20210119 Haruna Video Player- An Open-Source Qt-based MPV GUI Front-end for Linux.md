======

_**Brief: A Qt-based video player for Linux that acts as a front-end to mpv along with the ability to use youtube-dl.**_

### Haruna Video Player: A Qt-based Free Video Player

![Haruna Video Player][1]

In case you’re not aware of [mpv][2], it is a free and open-source command-line based media player. Okay, there is a [minimalist GUI for MPV][3] but at the core, it is command line.

You might also find several [open-source video players][4] that are basically the GUI front-end to mpv.

Haruna video player is one of them along with the ability to [use youtube-dl][5]. You can easily play local media files as well as YouTube content.

Let me give you an overview of the features offered with this player.

Unfortunately (or not), depending on what you prefer, you can only install it [using Flatpak][9]. You can install it on any Linux distribution using the [Flatpak package][10].

You can find it in [AUR][11] as well if you’re using an Arch-based system.

But, if you do not prefer that, you may take a look at the source code on [GitHub][12] to see if you can build it yourself like a normal Gentoo user.
