#### Should you get certified?

![][4]

This is the question I have been asked regularly. Are Linux certifications worth it? The short answer is yes.

As per the [open source jobs report in 2018][5], over 80% of open source professionals said that certifications helped with their careers. Certifications enable you to demonstrate technical knowledge to potential employers and thus certifications make you more employable in general.

Almost half of the hiring managers said that employing certified open source professionals is a priority for them.

Certifications from a reputed authority like Linux Foundation, Red Hat, LPIC etc are particularly helpful when you are a fresh graduate or if you want to switch to a new domain in your career.
