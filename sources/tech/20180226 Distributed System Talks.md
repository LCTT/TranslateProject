Distributed System Talks
======

From 2014 until 2016, I ran the [Utah Distributed Systems Meetup and Reading Group][1].

Sometimes I did a bad job at finding a better presenter and ended up covering topics myself. Even though we [often recorded video][2], all I have from my presentations are slide decks.

So, I thought they might be worth sharing:

  * [JT presents the Raft Consensus protocol][3]
  * [JT presents the Kademlia DHT][4]
  * [JT presents an introduction to metrics and tracing][5]
  * [JT presents MapReduce and Spark][6]
