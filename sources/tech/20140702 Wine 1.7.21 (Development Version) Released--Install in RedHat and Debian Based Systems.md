### Installing Wine 1.7.21 Development Version in Linux ###

Unfortunately, there are no official Wine repository available for the **Red Hat** based systems and the only way to install Wine, is to compile it from source. To do this, you need to install some dependency packages such as gcc, flex, bison, libX11-devel freetype-devel and Development Tools, etc. These packages are must required to compile Wine from source. Let’s install them using following **YUM** command.

#### On RedHat, Fedora and CentOS ####

    # yum -y groupinstall 'Development Tools'
    # yum -y install flex bison libX11-devel freetype-devel

Next, download the latest development version of Wine (i.e. **1.7.21**) and extract the source tallball package using the following commands.

    $ cd /tmp
    $ wget http://citylan.dl.sourceforge.net/project/wine/Source/wine-1.7.21.tar.bz2
    $ tar -xvf wine-1.7.21.tar.bz2 -C /tmp/

Now, it’s time to compile and build Wine installer using the following commands as normal user. (**Note**: The installation process might take up-to **15-20** minutes depending upon your internet and hardware speed, during installation it will ask you to enter **root** password.

**On 32-Bit Systems**

    $ cd wine-1.7.21/
    $ ./tools/wineinstall

**On 64-Bit Systems**

    $ cd wine-1.7.21/
    $ ./configure --enable-win64
    $ make
    # make install

#### On Ubuntu, Debian and Linux Mint ####

Under **Ubuntu** based systems, you can easily install the latest development build of Wine using the official **PPA**. Open a terminal and run the following commands with sudo privileges.

    $ sudo add-apt-repository ppa:ubuntu-wine/ppa 
    $ sudo apt-get update
    $ sudo apt-get install wine 1.7 winetricks

**Note**: At the time of writing this article, available version was **1.7.20** and the new build not yet updated in official Wine Repository, but the above instructions will install **1.7.21** when they made available.
