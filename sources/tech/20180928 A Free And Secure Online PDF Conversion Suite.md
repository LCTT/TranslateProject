One of the first things that catches your eye is the sleek user interface which gives the tool clean and functional environment in where you can work comfortably. The whole experience is even better because there are no ads on a website at all.

All different types of conversions have their dedicated menu with a simple box to add files, so you don’t have to wonder about what you need to do.

Most websites aren’t optimized to work well and run smoothly on mobile phones, but EasyPDF is an exception from that rule. It opens almost instantly on smartphone and is easy to navigate. You can also add it as the shortcut on your home screen from the **three dots menu** on the Chrome app.

### Functionality

Apart from looking nice, EasyPDF is pretty straightforward to use. You **don’t need to register** or leave an **email** to use the tool. It is completely anonymous. Additionally, it doesn’t put any limitations to the number or size of files for conversion. No installation required either! Cool, yeah?

You choose a desired conversion format, for example, PDF to Word. Select the PDF file you want to convert. You can upload a file from the device by either drag & drop or selecting the file from the folder. There is also an option to upload a document from [**Google Drive**][1] or [**Dropbox**][2].

After you choose the file, press the Convert button to start the conversion process. You won’t wait for a long time to get your file because conversion will finish in a minute. If you have some more files to convert, remember to download the file before you proceed further. If you don’t download the document first, you will lose it.
