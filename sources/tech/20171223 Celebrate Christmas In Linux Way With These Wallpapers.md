Celebrate Christmas In Linux Way With These Wallpapers
======

It’s the holiday season and many of you might be celebrating Christmas already. From the team of It’s FOSS, I would like to wish you a Merry Christmas and a happy new year.

To continue the festive mood, I’ll show you some really awesome [Linux wallpapers][1] on Christmas theme. But before we see that, how about a Christmas Tree in Linux terminal.

### Display Christmas Tree in Linux Terminal

If you want to display an animated Christmas tree in the terminal, you can use the command below:

```
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sergiolepore/ChristBASHTree/master/tree-EN.sh | bash
```

If you don’t want to get it from the internet all the time, you can get the shell script from its GitHub repository, change the permission and run it like a normal shell script.

### Display Christmas Tree in Linux terminal using Perl

[![Christmas Tree in Linux terminal by NixCraft][3]][4]

This trick was originally shared by [NixCraft][5]. You’ll need to install a Perl module for this.

To be honest, I don’t like using Perl modules because uninstalling them is a real pain. So **use this Perl module knowing that you’ll have to manually remove it**.

```
perl -MCPAN -e 'install Acme::POE::Tree'
```

You can read the original article [here][5] to know more about it.

## Download Linux Christmas Wallpapers

All these Linux Christmas wallpapers are created by Mark Riedesel and you can find plenty of other artwork on [his website][6].

He has been making such wallpapers almost every year since 2002. Quite understandably some of the earliest wallpapers don’t have modern aspect ratio. I have put them up in reverse chronological order.

One tiny note. The images displayed here are highly compressed so download the wallpapers from the provided link only.

### Bonus: Linux Christmas carols

Here is a bonus for you. Christmas carols Linuxified for Linux lovers like us.

In [an article on Computer World][51], [Sandra Henry-Stocker][52] shared such Christmas carols. An excerpt:

To the tune of: [Chestnuts Roasting on an Open Fire][53]

> Running merrily on open source
>  With users happy as can be
>  We’re using Linux and getting lots done
>  And happy everything is free

To the tune of: [The Twelve Days of Christmas][54]

> On my first day with Linux, my admin gave to me a password and a login ID
>  On my second day with Linux my admin gave to me two new commands and a password and a login ID

You can read full carols [here][51].

Merry Linux to you!!
