FOSS Weekly #23.36: De-Googled Fairphone 5, GNOME 45 Features, Pacman Commands and More
======

The month of September seems to be steaming with new releases. It's just the first week and we already have many new distro version releases. On top of that, GNOME 45 will be coming in the next two weeks.

By the way, have you looked at the resources section on the [It's FOSS homepage][1]? I am trying to make the homepage more useful by listing content organized in chapters, micro-courses and in-depth guides.

I hope you like this approach :)

**💬 Let's see what else you get in this edition of FOSS Weekly:**

  * Wayland support for IntelliJ IDEs
  * Using the Additional Drivers utility in Ubuntu
  * Various new distro version releases
  * And other Linux news, videos, Puzzles and, of course, memes!

Not really a feature as GNOME 45 will negatively impact extensions.

Your Linux system should normally handle the drivers well (if there are any). If there are more than one available for your system, you should see it in the Additional Drivers tool in Ubuntu.

## 💡 Quick handy tip

If you are running multiple terminal windows with different active commands (active means those that are not stopped after execution but running continuously, like top, less, etc.).

Then, you can move between windows that are running separate commands by searching for the command name in the GNOME shell search.

This also works for multiple tabs in one terminal window, where we can switch between tabs by entering the name of the command that is running in a particular tab.

## 🗓️ Tech Trivia

![][18]

Dennis Ritchie, the creator of C programming language and UNIX operating system, was born on September 9, 1941. He also created a lesser-known B programming language. Ritchie died on October 12, 2011. This computing legend's death did not get the due coverage as the media was busy mourning the recent demise of Steve Jobs.

A fascinating thread on Hyperbola Linux by one of our regulars.
