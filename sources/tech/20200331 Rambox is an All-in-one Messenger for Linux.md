Rambox is an All-in-one Messenger for Linux
======

_**Brief: Rambox is an all-in-one messenger that lets you combine multiple services like Discord, Slack, Facebook Messenger and hundreds of more such services in one place.**_

### Rambox: Add multiple messaging Services in a single app

![][1]

Rambox is one of the best ways to manage multiple services for communication through a single app installed. You can use [multiple messaging services][2] like Facebook Messenger, Gmail chats, AOL, Discord, Google Duo, [Viber][3] and a lot more from the same interface.

This way, you don’t need to install individual apps or keep them opened in browser all the time. You can use a master password to lock the Rambox application. You can also use do not disturb feature.

Rambox offers an [open source community edition][4] which is free to use. The paid pro version gives you access to 600+ apps while the community addition has 99+ apps. Pro version has additional features like themes, hibernation, ad-block, spell check and premium support.

Don’t worry. The open source community edition itself is quite useful and you may not even need those pro features.

### Features of Rambox

![][5]

While you should find most of the essential features in the open-source edition, you might notice some of them limited to the pro version.

Here, I’ve mentioned all the essential features available:

  * You get about 100 apps/services to choose from in the open-source edition
  * Ability to protect the app with a single Master password lock
  * Ability to lock each session that you load up
  * Do Not Disturb mode
  * Ability to sync apps and configuration across multiple devices.
  * You can create and add custom apps
  * Support for keyboard shortcuts
  * Ability to enable/disable apps without needing to delete them
  * JS &amp; CSS injection support to tweak the styling of apps
  * Ad-block (**pro version**)
  * Hibernation support (**pro version**)
  * Theme support (**pro version**)
  * Mobile view **(pro version)**
  * Spell check **(pro version)**
  * Work hours – to schedule a time for incoming notifications **(pro version)**
  * Proxies support **(pro version)**



In addition to what I’ve listed here, you might find some more features in the Rambox Pro edition. To know more about it, you can refer to the [official list of features][6].

It is also worth noting that you cannot have more than 3 active simultaneous device connections.

### Installing Rambox on Linux

You can easily get started using Rambox using the **.AppImage** file available on the [official download page][4]. If you’re curious, you can refer our guide on how to [use the AppImage file on Linux][7].

In either case, you can also get it from the [Snap store][8]. Also, feel free to check their [GitHub releases section][9] for **.deb / .rpm** or other packages.

[Download Rambox Community Edition][4]

### Wrapping Up

It can be a little overwhelming to have a lot of apps installed using Rambox. So, I’d suggest you monitor the RAM usage when adding more apps and using them for work.

There is also a similar app called [Franz][10] which is also part open source and part premium like Rambox.

Even though solutions like Rambox or Franz are quite useful, they aren’t always resource-friendly, specially if you start using tens of services at the same time. So, keep an eye on your system resources (if you notice a performance impact).

Otherwise, it’s an impressive app that does the work that you’d expect. Have you tried it out? Feel free to let me know your thoughts!
