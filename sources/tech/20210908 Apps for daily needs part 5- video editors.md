Video editing has become a popular activity. People need video editors for various reasons, such as work, education, or just a hobby. There are also now many platforms for sharing video on the internet. Almost all social media and chat messengers provide features for sharing videos. This article will introduce some of the open source video editors that you can use on Fedora Linux. You may need to install the software mentioned. If you are unfamiliar with how to add software packages in Fedora Linux, see my earlier article [Things to do after installing Fedora 34 Workstation][4]. Here is a list of a few apps for daily needs in the video editors category.

### Kdenlive

When anyone asks about an open source video editor on Linux, the answer that often comes up is Kdenlive. It is a very popular video editor among open source users. This is because its features are complete for general purposes and are easy to use by someone who is not a professional.

Kdenlive supports multi-track, so you can combine audio, video, images, and text from multiple sources. This application also supports various video and audio formats without having to convert them first. In addition, Kdenlive provides a wide variety of effects and transitions to support your creativity in producing cool videos. Some of the features that Kdenlive provides are titler for creating 2D titles, audio and video scopes, proxy editing, timeline preview, keyframeable effects, and many more.

### Pitivi

Pitivi will be the right choice if you want a video editor that has an intuitive and clean user interface. You will feel comfortable with how it looks and will have no trouble finding the features you need. This application is classified as very easy to learn, especially if you need an application for simple editing needs. However, Pitivi still offers a variety of features, like trimming &amp; cutting, sound mixing, keyframeable audio effects, audio waveforms, volume keyframe curves, video transitions, etc.

### Cinelerra

Cinelerra is a video editor that has been in development for a long time. There are tons of features for your video work such as built-in frame render, various video effects, unlimited layers, 8K support, multi camera support, video audio sync, render farm, motion graphics, live preview, etc. This application is maybe not suitable for those who are just learning. I think it will take you a while to get used to the interface, especially if you are already familiar with other popular video editor applications. But Cinelerra will still be an interesting choice as your video editor.
