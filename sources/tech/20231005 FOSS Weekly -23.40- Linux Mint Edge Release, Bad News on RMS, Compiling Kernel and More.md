FOSS Weekly #23.40: Linux Mint Edge Release, Bad News on RMS, Compiling Kernel and More
======

BTW, I use Arch Linux!

No, I am not joking. I have (re)installed Arch on my [TUXEDO InfinityBook][1] and using it as my daily driver these days. My main system still has Ubuntu 23.04, though.

The thing is that I had stopped 'exploring'. Blame it on my age, mid-thirties now👴🏽

Since I stopped exploring other distros, I did not encounter issues with them and hence no tutorials and tips on them. That's why some readers complained that there is _too much Ubuntu on It's FOSS_.

Out of my comfort zone now, I plan to use Arch Linux for at least a month. Expect plenty of Arch tutorials :)

Fedora, SUSE, Gentoo and Slackware are also on my list. But that's for the future.

💡 **User tip** :By the way, to ensure that you are getting genuine Linux advice and tutorials, add 'itsfoss' to your query on Google and other search engines. This way, you'll get articles from It's FOSS first (if we have covered the topic).

And if you get a topic which is not covered by us yet, do let us know. We shall try covering it.

**💬 Let's see what else you get in this edition of FOSS Weekly:**

## 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 FOSSverse corner

You don't always get the answers from search engines. This is why community forums are important. You can share your doubts and ask questions that have not been clearly answered in tutorials on the web.

Here's an example from It's FOSS Community.
