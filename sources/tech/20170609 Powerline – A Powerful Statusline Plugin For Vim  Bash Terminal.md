  powerline-daemon -q
  POWERLINE_BASH_CONTINUATION=1
  POWERLINE_BASH_SELECT=1
  . /usr/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/powerline/bindings/bash/powerline.sh

#### Add/Enable Powerline on tmux

Tmux is one of the best terminal emulator that offers multiple window and statusline but is not looks good compare with powerline statusline. Add following line to your `.tmux.conf` file which will enable powerline to tmux by default. If you don’t found `.tmux.conf` file then create a new one.

```
# vi ~/.tmuc.conf

source "/usr/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/powerline/bindings/tmux/powerline.conf"
