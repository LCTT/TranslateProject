ApacheCon Europe 2019 to Focus on Big Data, Community, IoT, Machine Learning and Open Source Design
======

If you’ve been following Apache Software Foundation (ASF) announcements for ApacheCon 2019, you must be aware of the conference in Las Vegas ([ApacheCon North America][1]) from September 9 to September 12.

And, recently, they announced their plans for ApacheCon Europe 2019 to be held on 22-24 October 2019 at the iconic [Kulturbrauerei][2] in Berlin, Germany. It is going to be one of the major events by ASF this year. In this article, we shall take a look at the details revealed as of yet.

In case you didn’t know about the [Apache Software Foundation][3], do note that it is one of the biggest open-source foundations out there, influencing a lot of good things.

### ApacheCon Europe 2019

![Apache Con Europe][4]

ApacheCon Europe will involve developers from Fortune 500 companies and start-ups, educators, consultants, community managers, Open Source enthusiasts, influencers, and analysts from more than 60 countries.

And, all of them will be showcasing their key open source technologies independent of business interests, corporate bias, or sales pitches.

In their press release, they have also mentioned how they select the content for the conference:

_ApacheCon content is selected entirely by Apache projects and their communities, enabling participants at all levels to learn about the latest innovations in dozens of categories. The ApacheCon Europe program categories include **Big Data, Community, IoT, Machine Learning, and Open Source Design**, among others. Participants learn about Open Source development “The Apache Way”, through hands-on sessions, keynotes, real-world case studies, hackathons, and more in a deliberately intimate, collaborative, vendor-neutral environment._

In addition to all these, ApacheCon also celebrates the 20th anniversary of the Apache Software Foundation this year. So, if you are planning to join the conference, get ready for some special events or activities.
