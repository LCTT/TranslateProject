6 Amazing Linux Distributions For Kids

Linux and open source is the future and there is no doubt about that, and to see this come to a reality, a strong foundation has to be lied, by starting from the lowest level possible and that is exposing kids to Linux and teaching them how to use Linux operating systems.

Linux is a very powerful operating system and that is one of the reasons why it powers a lot of servers on the Internet. Though there have been concerns about its user friendliness which has brought about debate of how it will over take Mac OSX and Windows on desktop computers, I think users need to accept Linux as it is to realize its real power.

Today, Linux powers a lot of machines out there, from mobile phones, to tablets, laptops, workstations, servers, supercomputers, cars, air traffic control systems, refrigerators and many more. With all this and more yet to come in the near future, as I had already stated at the beginning, Linux is the operating system for future computing.

Because the future belongs to the kids of today, then introducing them to technologies that will change the future is the way to go. Therefore they have to be introduced at an early stage to start learning computer technologies and Linux as a special case.

One thing common to children is curiosity and early learning can help instill the a character of exploration in them when the learning environment is designed to suit them.

Having looked some quick reasons why kids should learn Linux, let us now go through a list of exciting Linux distributions that you can introduce your kids to, so that they can start using and learning Linux.

### Sugar on a Stick

It is a project by Sugar Labs that aims at designing free tools to support learning among children by making them gain skills in exploring, discovering, creating and also reflecting on ideas. It is a non-profit organization led by volunteers.

### Qimo

I have added this to list because many readers are expected to ask about Qimo, but as of this writing, the Qimo for kids development team has retired from the project, therefore no more development it expected.

But you can still find most of the games for kids in Ubuntu and other Linux distributions. As they have mentioned, they are not done working on an educational software for kids and are developing an android application for children to improve their literacy skills.

You can read more from their official website and expect more from them in the future.

That is it for now, in case there are more Linux operating systems intended for kids or children out there, which I have not included in this list, you can let us know by leaving a comment.

You can also let us know of what you think of introducing kids to Linux and the future of Linux especially on Desktop computers.
