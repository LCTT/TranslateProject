### The Fedora Project and Slimbook announce a new ultrabook exclusively featuring Fedora software.

**RALEIGH, NC AND VALENCIA, SPAIN – October 11, 2023 –** Today, the Fedora Project and Slimbook are pleased to announce the Fedora Slimbook, a cutting-edge ultrabook.

Slimbook, renowned for its commitment to quality, innovation and support for the Linux community, has joined forces with the Fedora Project to bring users a new computing experience like never before. The Fedora Slimbook provides a sleek design, exclusively features Fedora software and boasts top-of-the-line features and performance enhancements, including:

  * 16” 16:10 sRGB 99%
  * 3K display 90Hz
  * Intel® Core™ i7-12700H 20 threads
  * NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3050 Ti
  * Up to 64GB RAM
  * Up to 4TB Nvme SSD
  * 82WH battery
  * 1.5 kg weight



The Fedora Slimbook is optimized for Fedora’s specific hardware configurations, thereby providing users with a smoother out-of-the-box experience. This hardware compatibility leads to an improved user experience, especially for those unfamiliar with how to install a Linux distribution themselves.

The Fedora Slimbook is the first Slimbook laptop that offers pre-installed Fedora software, combining Slimbook’s signature functional and stylish aesthetics with Fedora’s commitment to open source principles and focus on cutting-edge Linux distributions. The partnership between the Fedora Project and Slimbook exemplifies Fedora’s commitment to increasing the number of systems with pre-installed Linux and reducing barriers to entry for open source adoption.

In celebration of open source and the crucial role it plays in driving a more inclusive digital future, 3% of the revenue from each Fedora Slimbook ultrabook sale will be donated to the [GNOME Foundation][3], a global non-profit committed to building a diverse and sustainable computing ecosystem.
