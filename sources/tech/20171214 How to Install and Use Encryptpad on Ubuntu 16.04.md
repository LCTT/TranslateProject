Your file is now encrypted with key and passphrase.

If you want to decrypt this file, open **EncryptPad** , click on **File Encryption** , choose **Decryptio** option, provide the path of your encrypted file and path of the output file where you want to save the decrypted file, then provide path of the key file and click on the Start button, it will ask you for passphrase, enter your passphrase and click on Ok button to start the Decryption process.
