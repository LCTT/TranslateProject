Best 5 Alternatives to Microsoft Office [Compared]
======
Here we give you the five best alternatives to Microsoft Office. We compare them based on features, are easy to use and provide you with a guide to choosing the one you need.

We all agree that Microsoft Office is one of the best software developed by Mircosoft. It has a presence almost everywhere in the entire world in nearly every business. It is a fine piece of software that evolved over a few decades.

And obviously, it doesn’t have a Linux native installer and comes with a significant price. The current Microsoft Office 365 subscription pricing is a little higher if you are a business owner or a personal user. And not everyone can afford that price bucket for a longer time.

Then what are the alternatives? You can try other options that relatively get the job done for most users or businesses.

This article gives you the five best alternatives to Microsoft Office.

### Best Alternatives to Microsoft Office

### 1. LibreOffice

![LibreOffice][1]

The first alternative we highlight here is [LibreOffice][2]. The Document Foundation develops and manages the entire LibreOffice free and open-source office suite, available for Linux, macOS and Windows.

Firstly, it comes with a spreadsheet ([Calc][3]), word processor (Writer), presentation (Impress), drawing (Draw) and a database program (Base).

Secondly, this project is actively developed, and compatibility with Microsoft Office documents is improved in every release iteration. If appropriately used, LibreOffice can effectively do all the work that a Mircosoft office program does. In addition, a massive set of documentation and communities can help you adopt LibreOffice in no time.

You don’t need to pay for the software if you are a small or large corporation. But paid deployment and support are also available at minimal cost if you require them for your critical work.

However, LibreOffice does not come with an Outlook-like email program. This might be one of the minor drawbacks, but you can access emails from web browsers today for all email service providers.
