Not sure if you have noticed already, there is a 'resources' section at the lower half of the It's FOSS homepage. It features some of the tutorial series and detailed guides that you might not have found otherwise.

I have also added a '[Resources][1]' link in the top menu so you can access them from anywhere on It's FOSS website.
