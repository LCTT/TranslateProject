 **[Bitcoin][1]** is a digital currency or electronic cash the relies on peer to peer technology for completing transactions. Since peer to peer technology is used as the major network, bitcoins provide a community like managed economy. This is to mean, bitcoins eliminate the centralized authority way of managing currency and promotes community management of currency. Most Also of the software related to bitcoin mining and managing of bitcoin digital cash is open source. 

​The first Bitcoin software was developed by Satoshi Nakamoto and it's based on open source cryptographic protocol. Bitcoins smallest unit is known as the Satoshi which is basically one-hundredth millionth of a single bitcoin (0.00000001 BTC). 

One cannot underestimate the boundaries BITCOINS eliminate in the digital economy. For instance, the BITCOIN eliminates governed controls over currency by a centralised agency and offers control and management to the community as a whole. Furthermore, the fact that the BITCOIN is based on an open source cryptographic protocol makes it an open place where there are scrupulous activities such as fluctuating value, deflation and inflation among others. While many internet users are becoming aware of the privacy they should exercise to complete some online transactions, bitcoin is gaining more popularity than ever before. However, for those who know about the dark web and how it works can acknowledge that some people began using it long ago. 

On the downside, the bitcoin is also very secure in making anonymous payments which may be a threat to security or personal health. For instance, the dark web markets are the major suppliers and retailers of imported drugs and even weapons. The use of BITCOINs in the dark web facilitates a safe network for such criminal activities. Despite that, if put to good use, bitcoin has many benefits that can eliminate some of the economic fallacy as a result of centralized agency management of currency. In addition, the bitcoin allows for instance exchange of cash anywhere in the world. The use of bitcoins also mitigates counterfeiting, printing, or devaluation over time. Also, while relying on peer to peer network as its backbone, it promotes the distributed authority of transaction records making it safe to make exchanges. 

Other advantages of the bitcoin include;

*   In the online business world, bitcoin promotes money security and total control. This is because buyers are protected against merchants who may want to charge extra for a lower cost service. The buyer can also choose not to share personal information after making a transaction. Besides, identity theft protection is achieved as a result of backed up hiding personal information.  

*   Bitcoins are provided alternatives to major common currency catastrophes such as getting lost, frozen or damaged. However, it is recommended to always make a backup of your bitcoins and encrypt them with a password. 

*   In making online purchases and payments using bitcoins, there is a small fee or zero transaction fee charged. This promotes affordability of use.

*   Merchants also face fewer risks that could result from fraud as bitcoin transactions cannot be reversed, unlike other currencies in electronic form. Bitcoins also prove useful even in moments of high crime rate and fraud since it is difficult to con someone over an open public ledger (Blockchain).

*   Bitcoin currency is also hard to be manipulated as it is open source and the cryptographic protocol is very secure.

*   Transactions can also be verified and approved, anywhere, anytime. This is the level of flexibility offered by this digital currency.
