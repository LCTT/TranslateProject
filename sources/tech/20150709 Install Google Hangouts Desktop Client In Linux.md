Earlier, we have seen how to [install Facebook Messenger in Linux][1] and [WhatsApp desktop client in Linux][2]. Both of these were unofficial apps. I have one more unofficial app for today and it is [Google Hangouts][3].

Of course, you can use Google Hangouts in the web browser but it is more fun to use the desktop client than the web browser one. Curious? Let’s see how to **install Google Hangouts desktop client in Linux** and how to use it.

### Install Google Hangouts in Linux ###

We are going to use an open source project called [yakyak][4] which is unofficial Google Hangouts client for Linux, Windows and OS X. I’ll show you how to use yakyak in Ubuntu but I believe that you can use the same method to use it in other Linux distributions. Before we see how to use it, let’s first take a look at main features of yakyak:

- Send and receive chat messages
- Create and change conversations (rename, add people)
- Leave and/or delete conversation
- Desktop notifications
- Toggle notifications on/off
- Drag-drop, copy-paste or attach-button for image upload.
- Hangupsbot sync room aware (actual user pics)
- Shows inline images
- History scrollback

Sounds good enough? Download the installation files from the link below:

- [Download Google Hangout client yakyak][5]

The downloaded file would be compressed. Extract it and you will see a directory like linux-x64 or linux-x32 based on your system. Go in to this directory and you should see a file named yakyak. Double click on it to run it.

You’ll have to enter your Google Account credentials of course.

Once you are through, you’ll see a screen like the one below where you can chat with your Google contacts.

If you want to show profile pictures of the contacts, you can select View->Show conversation thumbnails.

You’ll also get desktop notification for new messages.

### Worth a try? ###

I let you give it a try and decide whether or not it is worth to **install Google Hangouts client in Linux**. If you want official apps, take a look at these [instant messaging applications with native Linux clients][6]. Don’t forget to share your experience with Google Hangouts in Linux.
