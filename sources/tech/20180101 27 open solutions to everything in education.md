开放式理念 (从开源软件到开放硬件, 再到开放原则) 正在改变教育的范式。因此, 为了庆祝今年发生的一切, 我收集了2017年在 Opensource.com 上发表的27篇关于这个主题的最好的文章。我把它们分成明确的主题, 而不是按人气来分类。而且, 如果这27个故事不能满足你对教育公开信息的胃口, 那就看看我们的协同文章吧 " [education is leveraging Raspberry Pi and Linux][30].

### 开放对每个人都有好处

1.  [Book review: 'OPEN' explores broad cultural implications of openness][1]:  Scott Nesbitt 评价David Price 的书 'OPEN' ，该书探讨了 "开放" 不仅仅是技术转变的观点, 而是 "我们未来将如何工作、生活和学习"。

2.  [Jump-start your career with open source skills][2]:  VM (Vicky) Brasseur 指出了如何利用开放式学习在工作群体中脱颖而出。 这个建议不仅仅是针对程序员的, 而是针对程序员的。设计师、作家、营销人员和其他创意专业人士也是开放式成功的关键。

3.  [A graduate degree could springboard you into an open source job][3]:  引用的研究表明会 Linux 技能会带来更高的薪水, Joshua Pearce 说对开源的熟练和研究生学位是无与伦比的职业技能组合。

4.  [These 3 practices revolutionized Penn Manor's school culture][4]:  Charlie Reisinger 向我们展示了开放的做法是如何在宾夕法尼亚州的一个学区创造一种更具包容性、敏捷性和开放性的文化的。 Charlie 说, 这不仅仅是为了省钱;该区还受益于 "开放式领导原则, 促进师生创新, 帮助更好地吸引社区, 创造一个更有活力和包容性的学习社区"。

5.  [15 ways to empower students with open source tools][5]: 我写开源是如何让学生自由探索、补拙和学习的, 不管他们是在学习基本的数字化素养, 还是通过有趣的项目来扩展这些技能。

6.  [Developer opportunities to code for good][6]: 开源往往是对社会有益的项目的支柱。正如 Benetech Labs 副总裁 Ahn Bui 在这次采访中指出的那样: "建立开放数据标准是打破数据孤岛不可或缺的一步。这些开放标准将为互操作性提供基础, 进而转化为更多的组织共同建设, 往往更具成本效益。最终目标是以同样的成本甚至更低的成本为更多的人服务。

### Open education resources for remixing and reusing

1.  [Can academic faculty members teach with Wikipedia?][7] LiAnna Davis, director of programs for Wiki Ed, discusses how open educational resources (OERs), such as Wiki Ed, are providing high-quality and affordable open source learning resources as classroom teaching tools.

2.  [Are textbooks in or out? The state of open educational resources][8]: Cable Green, director of open education for Creative Commons, shares how the face of education is changing in higher education and what Creative Commons is doing to facilitate it.

3.  [School systems desperate for standards-aligned curricula find hope][9]: Karen Vaites, community evangelist and chief marketing officer of Open Up Resources, talks about the nonprofit organization's efforts to provide open, standards-aligned curricula for K-12 schools.

4.  [How the University of Hawaii is solving today's higher ed problems][10]: Billy Meinke, educational technologist at the University of Hawaii at Manoa, says that transitioning to OER in college courses will "empower faculty to take control of what content they teach with, which we expect will result in their saving students money."

5.  [How open courses are slashing the cost of higher education][11]: Saylor Academy's director of education Devon Ritter reports how Saylor is building its college credit-eligible courses on openly licensed content, with the goal of making higher education affordable and accessible to more people.

6.  [Open educational resources movement gains speed][12]: Alexis Clifton, executive director of the State University of New York OER Services, describes how New York's US$ 8 million investment is spurring growth in open education and making college more affordable.

7.  [Open project collaboration from elementary to university classrooms][13]: Aria F. Chernik from Duke University explores OSPRI (Open Source Pedagogy Research and Innovation), a collaboration between Duke and Red Hat that's building a 21st-century, preK-12 learning ecosystem that is open by design.

8.  [Perma.cc stops scholarly link rot][14]: Virginia Tech's Phillip Young writes about Perma.cc, a solution to "link rot," which is the high probability that hyperlinks in academic papers will disappear or change over time.

9.  [Open education: How students save money by creating open textbooks][15]: OER pioneer Robin DeRosa talks about "the freedom that the openly licensed textbook introduced, and the overarching idea that education and learning should be contextualized in inclusive ecosystems that enhance the public good."

### Open source tools in the classroom

1.  [How an open source board game is saving the planet][16]: Joshua Pearce writes about Save the Planet, a board game that empowers students to solve environmental problems while having fun and contributing to the maker community.

2.  [A new Android app for teaching kids how to read][17]: Michael Hall talks about Phoenicia, a children's literacy app he developed after his son was diagnosed with autism, the value of coding for good, and why user testing matters more than you think.

3.  [8 open source Android apps for education][18]: Joshua Allen Holm challenges us to use our smartphones as learning tools by recommending eight open source apps from the F-Droid repository to try.

4.  [3 open source alternatives to MATLAB][19]: Jason Baker's update to his 2016 survey of open source mathematical computing software presents alternatives to MATLAB, the expensive, proprietary solution nearly ubiquitous in mathematics, physical sciences, engineering, and economics.

5.  [What does SVG have to do with teaching kids to code?][20] Retired engineer Jay Nick talks about how he uses art as a creative way to introduce students to coding. He volunteers in schools, using Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) to teach an approach to coding that combines principles of mathematics and art.

6.  [5 myths busted: Using open source in higher education][21]: Kyle Conway, who holds a PhD in fine arts from Texas Tech, shares his experience using open source tools in a world ruled by proprietary solutions. Kyle says there's a bias against using open source in disciplines outside of computer science: "Many people think non-technical students can't use Linux, and they make a lot of assumptions about people who use it in their advanced degree programs. … Well, it is possible, and I'm proof."

7.  [A list of open source tools for college][22]: Aaron Cocker outlines the open source tools (including presentation, backup, and programming software) he uses while working on his undergraduate degree in computer science.

8.  [5 great KDE apps to help you study][23]: Zsolt Szakács offers five KDE applications that help anyone who wants to learn new skills or cultivate existing ones.

### Coding in the classroom

1.  [How to get the next generation coding early][24]: Bryson Payne says we need to teach kids to code before high school: By ninth grade 80% of girls and 60% of boys have already self-selected out of a STEM career. But it's not only about jobs and closing the IT skills gap, he suggests. "Teaching a young person to code could be the single most life-changing skill you can give them. And it's not just a career-enhancer. Coding is about problem-solving, it's about creativity, and more importantly, it's about empowerment."

2.  [Kids can't code without computers][25]: Patrick Masson introduces the FLOSS Desktops for Kids program, which teaches students at underserved schools to repurpose older computers with open source software, such as Linux, LibreOffice, and GIMP. Not only is the program breathing new life into broken or decommissioned hardware, it's also giving students important skills that may translate into future careers.

3.  [Is Scratch today like the Logo of the '80s for teaching kids to code?][26] Anderson Silva offers suggestions for using [Scratch][27] to spark kids' interest in programming, just as LOGO did when he started using it in the 1980s.

4.  [Learn Android development with this drag-and-drop framework][28]: Eric Eslinger describes App Inventor, a programming framework for building Android applications using a visual blocks language (similar to Scratch or [Snap][29]).

Throughout the year we learned that there is an open solution to everything in education, and I expect this theme to continue in 2018 and beyond. Are there open education topics you'd like Opensource.com to cover in the coming year? If so, please share your ideas in the comments.
