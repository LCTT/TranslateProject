## 🕊️ RIP, OTB

I recently got to know that [OldTechBloke][9] has passed away. He was part of the Linux community and known for his YouTube videos where he shared his experiments and experience with desktop Linux.

According to his last video, he mentioned that he and his wife were facing some major health issues (around 12:20). It is sad to see such a kind soul passing away. Rest in Peace.

## 💡 Quick handy tip

You can prevent the accidental entering of characters in a running GNOME terminal session by making it read-only.

To do this, click on the top-right hamburger menu and check the option 'Read-Only'.

It can also be done by right-clicking on a terminal window and selecting 'Read-Only'.

To enable input of characters, revert the process.
