Take Tidelift's 4th annual open source survey
======
Participate in Tidelift’s fourth annual open source survey and help shed
light on how organizations manage their use of open source components
for application development.
![Team of people around the world][1]

Using open source components has become the de facto way to develop modern applications. The increased adoption of open source has brought with it a new set of challenges and obstacles, and Tidelift, for the fourth year in a row, has [launched a survey][2] to gather new data about how organizations are using open source to build enterprise applications. 

Previous surveys have helped reveal the impact of key issues that companies of all sizes encounter.

Tidelift's hope with its latest survey is to determine what has changed and what has remained the same, and where there has been change, what positive learnings can we derive from them. Tidelift is particularly keen to explore areas such as:

  * The challenges organizations and development teams face when using open source for building applications and how they are addressing them.
  * The impact of cybersecurity threats, how security teams are normalizing open source usage, and whether it affects their policies and practices.
  * How organizations might be preparing to address recent government and industry regulations to improve the health and safety of the software supply chain.
