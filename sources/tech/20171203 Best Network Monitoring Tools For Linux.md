Best Network Monitoring Tools For Linux
===============================


Keeping control of our network is vital to prevent any program from overusing it and slows down the overall system operation. There are several

**network monitoring tools**

for different operating systems today. In this article, we will talk about

**10 network monitoring tools for Linux**

that will run from a terminal, ideal for users who do not use GUI or for those who want to keep a control of the network use of a server through from ssh.

### Iftop

Arpwatch is a program that is designed to control the resolution of addresses (MAC and changes in the IP address) of Ethernet network traffic in a Linux network. It is continuously monitoring the Ethernet traffic and records the changes in the IP addresses and MAC addresses, the changes of pairs along with the timestamps in a network. It also has a function to send an e-mail notifying the administrator, when a couple is added or changes. It is very useful in detecting ARP impersonation in a network.

Initially known as Ethereal, Wireshark highlights an easy to understand interface that can show information from many diverse conventions on all real system sorts.

### Conclusion

​In this article, we have taken a gander at a few open source network monitoring tools. Because we concentrated on these instruments as the "best" does not really mean they are the best for your need. For instance, there are numerous other open source monitoring apparatuses that exist, for example, OpenNMS, Cacti, and Zennos and you need to consider the advantages of everyone from the point of view of your prerequisite.

Additionally, there are different apparatuses that might be more good for your need that is not open source.
