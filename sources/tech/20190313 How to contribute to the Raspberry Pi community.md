How to contribute to the Raspberry Pi community
======
Find ways to get involved in the Raspberry Pi community in the 13th
article in our getting-started series.
![][1]

Things are starting to wind down in this series, and as much fun as I've had writing it, mostly I hope it has helped someone out there use start using a Raspberry Pi for education or entertainment. Maybe the articles convinced you to buy your first Raspberry Pi or perhaps helped you rediscover the device that was collecting dust in a drawer. If any of that is true, I'll consider the series a success.

If you now want to pay it forward and help spread the word on how versatile this little green digital board is, here are a few ways you can get connected to the Raspberry Pi community:

  * Contribute to improving the [official documentation][2]
  * Contribute code to [projects][3] the Raspberry Pi depends on
  * File [bugs][4] with Raspbian
  * File bugs with the different ARM architecture platform distributions
  * Help kids learn to code by taking a look at the Raspberry Pi Foundation's [Code Club][5] in the UK or [Code Club International][6] outside the UK
  * Help with [translation][7]
  * Volunteer on a [Raspberry Jam][8]



These are just a few of the ways you can contribute to the Raspberry Pi community. Last but not least, you can join me and [contribute articles][9] to your favorite open source website, [Opensource.com][10]. :-)
