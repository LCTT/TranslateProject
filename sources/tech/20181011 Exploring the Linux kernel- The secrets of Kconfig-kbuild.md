The Linux kernel config/build system, also known as Kconfig/kbuild, has been around for a long time, ever since the Linux kernel code migrated to Git. As supporting infrastructure, however, it is seldom in the spotlight; even kernel developers who use it in their daily work never really think about it.

To explore how the Linux kernel is compiled, this article will dive into the Kconfig/kbuild internal process, explain how the .config file and the vmlinux/bzImage files are produced, and introduce a smart trick for dependency tracking.

### Kconfig

The first step in building a kernel is always configuration. Kconfig helps make the Linux kernel highly modular and customizable. Kconfig offers the user many config targets:
| config         | Update current config utilizing a line-oriented program                         |
| nconfig        | Update current config utilizing a ncurses menu-based program                    |
| menuconfig     | Update current config utilizing a menu-based program                            |
| xconfig        | Update current config utilizing a Qt-based frontend                             |
| gconfig        | Update current config utilizing a GTK+ based frontend                           |
| oldconfig      | Update current config utilizing a provided .config as base                      |
| localmodconfig | Update current config disabling modules not loaded                              |
| localyesconfig | Update current config converting local mods to core                             |
| defconfig      | New config with default from Arch-supplied defconfig                            |
| savedefconfig  | Save current config as ./defconfig (minimal config)                             |
| allnoconfig    | New config where all options are answered with 'no'                             |
| allyesconfig   | New config where all options are accepted with 'yes'                            |
| allmodconfig   | New config selecting modules when possible                                      |
| alldefconfig   | New config with all symbols set to default                                      |
| randconfig     | New config with a random answer to all options                                  |
| listnewconfig  | List new options                                                                |
| olddefconfig   | Same as oldconfig but sets new symbols to their default value without prompting |
| kvmconfig      | Enable additional options for KVM guest kernel support                          |
| xenconfig      | Enable additional options for xen dom0 and guest kernel support                 |
| tinyconfig     | Configure the tiniest possible kernel                                           |

I think **menuconfig** is the most popular of these targets. The targets are processed by different host programs, which are provided by the kernel and built during kernel building. Some targets have a GUI (for the user's convenience) while most don't. Kconfig-related tools and source code reside mainly under **scripts/kconfig/** in the kernel source. As we can see from **scripts/kconfig/Makefile** , there are several host programs, including **conf** , **mconf** , and **nconf**. Except for **conf** , each of them is responsible for one of the GUI-based config targets, so, **conf** deals with most of them.

Logically, Kconfig's infrastructure has two parts: one implements a [new language][1] to define the configuration items (see the Kconfig files under the kernel source), and the other parses the Kconfig language and deals with configuration actions.

Most of the config targets have roughly the same internal process (shown below):

![](https://opensource.com/sites/default/files/uploads/kconfig_process.png)

Note that all configuration items have a default value.

The first step reads the Kconfig file under source root to construct an initial configuration database; then it updates the initial database by reading an existing configuration file according to this priority:

> .config
>  /lib/modules/$(shell,uname -r)/.config
>  /etc/kernel-config
>  /boot/config-$(shell,uname -r)
>  ARCH_DEFCONFIG
>  arch/$(ARCH)/defconfig

If you are doing GUI-based configuration via **menuconfig** or command-line-based configuration via **oldconfig** , the database is updated according to your customization. Finally, the configuration database is dumped into the .config file.

But the .config file is not the final fodder for kernel building; this is why the **syncconfig** target exists. **syncconfig** used to be a config target called **silentoldconfig** , but it doesn't do what the old name says, so it was renamed. Also, because it is for internal use (not for users), it was dropped from the list.

Here is an illustration of what **syncconfig** does:

![](https://opensource.com/sites/default/files/uploads/syncconfig.png)

**syncconfig** takes .config as input and outputs many other files, which fall into three categories:

  * **auto.conf & tristate.conf** are used for makefile text processing. For example, you may see statements like this in a component's makefile:

```
     obj-$(CONFIG_GENERIC_CALIBRATE_DELAY) += calibrate.o
```

  * **autoconf.h** is used in C-language source files.

  * Empty header files under **include/config/** are used for configuration-dependency tracking during kbuild, which is explained below.




After configuration, we will know which files and code pieces are not compiled.

### kbuild

Component-wise building, called _recursive make_ , is a common way for GNU `make` to manage a large project. Kbuild is a good example of recursive make. By dividing source files into different modules/components, each component is managed by its own makefile. When you start building, a top makefile invokes each component's makefile in the proper order, builds the components, and collects them into the final executive.

Kbuild refers to different kinds of makefiles:

  * **Makefile** is the top makefile located in source root.
  * **.config** is the kernel configuration file.
  * **arch/$(ARCH)/Makefile** is the arch makefile, which is the supplement to the top makefile.
  * **scripts/Makefile.*** describes common rules for all kbuild makefiles.
  * Finally, there are about 500 **kbuild makefiles**.



The top makefile includes the arch makefile, reads the .config file, descends into subdirectories, invokes **make** on each component's makefile with the help of routines defined in **scripts/Makefile.*** , builds up each intermediate object, and links all the intermediate objects into vmlinux. Kernel document [Documentation/kbuild/makefiles.txt][2] describes all aspects of these makefiles.

As an example, let's look at how vmlinux is produced on x86-64:

![vmlinux overview][4]

(The illustration is based on Richard Y. Steven's [blog][5]. It was updated and is used with the author's permission.)

All the **.o** files that go into vmlinux first go into their own **built-in.a** , which is indicated via variables **KBUILD_VMLINUX_INIT** , **KBUILD_VMLINUX_MAIN** , **KBUILD_VMLINUX_LIBS** , then are collected into the vmlinux file.

Take a look at how recursive make is implemented in the Linux kernel, with the help of simplified makefile code:

```
    # In top Makefile
    vmlinux: scripts/link-vmlinux.sh $(vmlinux-deps)
                    +$(call if_changed,link-vmlinux)

    # Variable assignments
    vmlinux-deps := $(KBUILD_LDS) $(KBUILD_VMLINUX_INIT) $(KBUILD_VMLINUX_MAIN) $(KBUILD_VMLINUX_LIBS)

    export KBUILD_VMLINUX_INIT := $(head-y) $(init-y)
    export KBUILD_VMLINUX_MAIN := $(core-y) $(libs-y2) $(drivers-y) $(net-y) $(virt-y)
    export KBUILD_VMLINUX_LIBS := $(libs-y1)
    export KBUILD_LDS          := arch/$(SRCARCH)/kernel/vmlinux.lds

    init-y          := init/
    drivers-y       := drivers/ sound/ firmware/
    net-y           := net/
    libs-y          := lib/
    core-y          := usr/
    virt-y          := virt/

    # Transform to corresponding built-in.a
    init-y          := $(patsubst %/, %/built-in.a, $(init-y))
    core-y          := $(patsubst %/, %/built-in.a, $(core-y))
    drivers-y       := $(patsubst %/, %/built-in.a, $(drivers-y))
    net-y           := $(patsubst %/, %/built-in.a, $(net-y))
    libs-y1         := $(patsubst %/, %/lib.a, $(libs-y))
    libs-y2         := $(patsubst %/, %/built-in.a, $(filter-out %.a, $(libs-y)))
    virt-y          := $(patsubst %/, %/built-in.a, $(virt-y))

    # Setup the dependency. vmlinux-deps are all intermediate objects, vmlinux-dirs
    # are phony targets, so every time comes to this rule, the recipe of vmlinux-dirs
    # will be executed. Refer "4.6 Phony Targets" of `info make`
    $(sort $(vmlinux-deps)): $(vmlinux-dirs) ;

    # Variable vmlinux-dirs is the directory part of each built-in.a
    vmlinux-dirs    := $(patsubst %/,%,$(filter %/, $(init-y) $(init-m) \
                         $(core-y) $(core-m) $(drivers-y) $(drivers-m) \
                         $(net-y) $(net-m) $(libs-y) $(libs-m) $(virt-y)))

    # The entry of recursive make
    $(vmlinux-dirs):
                    $(Q)$(MAKE) $(build)=$@ need-builtin=1
```

The recursive make recipe is expanded, for example:

```
    make -f scripts/Makefile.build obj=init need-builtin=1
```

This means **make** will go into **scripts/Makefile.build** to continue the work of building each **built-in.a**. With the help of **scripts/link-vmlinux.sh** , the vmlinux file is finally under source root.

#### Understanding vmlinux vs. bzImage

Many Linux kernel developers may not be clear about the relationship between vmlinux and bzImage. For example, here is their relationship in x86-64:

![](https://opensource.com/sites/default/files/uploads/vmlinux-bzimage.png)

The source root vmlinux is stripped, compressed, put into **piggy.S** , then linked with other peer objects into **arch/x86/boot/compressed/vmlinux**. Meanwhile, a file called setup.bin is produced under **arch/x86/boot**. There may be an optional third file that has relocation info, depending on the configuration of **CONFIG_X86_NEED_RELOCS**.

A host program called **build** , provided by the kernel, builds these two (or three) parts into the final bzImage file.

#### Dependency tracking

Kbuild tracks three kinds of dependencies:

  1. All prerequisite files (both * **.c** and * **.h** )
  2. **CONFIG_** options used in all prerequisite files
  3. Command-line dependencies used to compile the target



The first one is easy to understand, but what about the second and third? Kernel developers often see code pieces like this:

```
    #ifdef CONFIG_SMP
    __boot_cpu_id = cpu;
    #endif
```

When **CONFIG_SMP** changes, this piece of code should be recompiled. The command line for compiling a source file also matters, because different command lines may result in different object files.

When a **.c** file uses a header file via a **#include** directive, you need write a rule like this:

```
    main.o: defs.h
            recipe...
```

When managing a large project, you need a lot of these kinds of rules; writing them all would be tedious and boring. Fortunately, most modern C compilers can write these rules for you by looking at the **#include** lines in the source file. For the GNU Compiler Collection (GCC), it is just a matter of adding a command-line parameter: **-MD depfile**

```
    # In scripts/Makefile.lib
    c_flags        = -Wp,-MD,$(depfile) $(NOSTDINC_FLAGS) $(LINUXINCLUDE)     \
                     -include $(srctree)/include/linux/compiler_types.h       \
                     $(__c_flags) $(modkern_cflags)                           \
                     $(basename_flags) $(modname_flags)
```

This would generate a **.d** file with content like:

```
    init_task.o: init/init_task.c include/linux/kconfig.h \
     include/generated/autoconf.h include/linux/init_task.h \
     include/linux/rcupdate.h include/linux/types.h \
     ...
```

Then the host program **[fixdep][6]** takes care of the other two dependencies by taking the **depfile** and command line as input, then outputting a **. <target>.cmd** file in makefile syntax, which records the command line and all the prerequisites (including the configuration) for a target. It looks like this:

```
    # The command line used to compile the target
    cmd_init/init_task.o := gcc -Wp,-MD,init/.init_task.o.d  -nostdinc ...
    ...
    # The dependency files
    deps_init/init_task.o := \
    $(wildcard include/config/posix/timers.h) \
    $(wildcard include/config/arch/task/struct/on/stack.h) \
    $(wildcard include/config/thread/info/in/task.h) \
    ...
      include/uapi/linux/types.h \
      arch/x86/include/uapi/asm/types.h \
      include/uapi/asm-generic/types.h \
      ...
```

A **. <target>.cmd** file will be included during recursive make, providing all the dependency info and helping to decide whether to rebuild a target or not.

The secret behind this is that **fixdep** will parse the **depfile** ( **.d** file), then parse all the dependency files inside, search the text for all the **CONFIG_** strings, convert them to the corresponding empty header file, and add them to the target's prerequisites. Every time the configuration changes, the corresponding empty header file will be updated, too, so kbuild can detect that change and rebuild the target that depends on it. Because the command line is also recorded, it is easy to compare the last and current compiling parameters.

### Looking ahead

Kconfig/kbuild remained the same for a long time until the new maintainer, Masahiro Yamada, joined in early 2017, and now kbuild is under active development again. Don't be surprised if you soon see something different from what's in this article.
