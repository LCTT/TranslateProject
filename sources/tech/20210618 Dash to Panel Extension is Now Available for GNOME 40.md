Since the GNOME 40 launch, users were waiting for the popular extensions to be ported to new GNOME workflow. Many extensions were already ported as we speak. And now with this popular extension helps you to bring back the old-school panel and icons to your desktop taskbar.

### GNOME 40 Dash to Panel Extension

The dash to panel gives you many options to customize your desktop experience. I am going to explain in brief. But you might be wondering how this extension is integrating with the existing GNOME 40 flow.

With this extension, you can have a of your desktop.

So, when you enable this extension the default top bar should be gone. And you get a default bottom panel with all the system tray icons.

With that, you get a list of application launchers that you already added as a favorite. And the Application label is gone and replaced by the earlier launcher icons.

The first default workspace view of GNOME 40 that gave you the dock and the workspace is eliminated. Because it is not required anymore as you have the panel already with your favorite launchers.

So, when you hit the super key from the keyboard you get the old workspace view. But if you click on the panel application icon, then you get the application grid and workspace overview screen.

That means, hitting the super key doesn’t bring up the application grid and workspace overview. You have to click on the icon. Which I think, a bit confusing at first. But you develop muscle memory eventually.

  * System tray icons and indicators.
