15 Top Open Source Artificial Intelligence Tools
====

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is one of the hottest areas of technology research. Companies like IBM, Google, Microsoft, Facebook and Amazon are investing heavily in their own R&D, as well as buying up startups that have made progress in areas like machine learning, neural networks, natural language and image processing. Given the level of interest, it should come as no surprise that a recent [artificial intelligence report][1] from experts at Stanford University concluded that "increasingly useful applications of AI, with potentially profound positive impacts on our society and economy are likely to emerge between now and 2030."

In a recent [article][2], we provided an overview of 45 AI projects that seem particularly promising or interesting. In this slideshow, we're focusing in on open source artificial intelligence tools, with a closer look at fifteen of the best-known open source AI projects.
