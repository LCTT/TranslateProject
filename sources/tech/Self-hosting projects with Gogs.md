In May, we noted the problems that GIMP and other free-software projects have encountered of late with the SourceForge project-hosting service. While there are plenty of alternative hosting providers to choose from, some developers will likely always prefer to self-host their projects—precisely because an outside service provider can make just such an abrupt or surprising about-face. Gogs is one option for those taking the self-hosting approach: it provides a web-based front-end to a GitHub-like hosting service. Gogs offers quite a few features, but its choice of GitHub-like qualities may not be to everyone's tastes.

When it comes to providing a globally visible home for a software project, one can certainly make do with gitweb or cgit running on a web server. They provide a quick overview of the latest changes in the codebase, a way to browse through a repository, project history, statistics, and more. But the reason that heavyweight hosting services like GitHub have taken off is that they integrate support for many of the common tasks that accompany managing a project but which are not tackled directly by Git itself.

These features include core processes like issue tracking, code review, and release management. In addition, though, project hosting sites add a social dimension: the ability to form teams of developers, to link between repositories, and to subscribe to updates from a particular repository or user account.

Gogs is a Git-hosting package that intentionally clones the look and feel of GitHub, but can be installed and run on a personal server. Since early 2014, it has been developed on GitHub itself—at some point, presumably, it may well be self-hosted, but for now the benefits of GitHub's large user base are key. The software is written in Go (the name of the project stemming from "GO Git Service"), and it can use MySQL, PostgreSQL, or SQLite as a database backend. Installable packages are available (in addition to source); with the latest Go runtime installed (version 1.4.2), one can get up and running with Gogs in a matter of minutes.

The most recent release is version 0.6.1 from March 26. Historically, the project has released a major (i.e., non-bugfix) release every six months or so, although it has not published a long-term roadmap detailing where development is headed. As it stands now, Gogs supports multiple user accounts, "team" organizations, and most of the core feature set for managing a Git repository as one would at GitHub. That includes issue tracking (complete with labeling and user assignment), milestones, releases, branch management, and even mirroring or one-click forking of existing repositories. On the social side, users can watch and "star" (i.e., favorite) repositories and follow an automatically generated feed of project or user activity.

That leaves several GitHub features unaddressed, though. Creating pull requests is not yet supported, nor is sharing code snippets (as in GitHub's gists). There are also no advanced project-hosting features like wikis or GitHub Pages, and Gogs lacks GitHub's pervasive statistics tools, which automatically generate charts and graphs from user and repository activity. Most of these features have an open feature request on the Gogs issue tracker, which underscores the project's apparent interest in closely following GitHub's lead.

I installed the 0.6.1 release from source on my desktop machine. There is little to say about the installation process, except that one must be running the latest and greatest Go runtime, which generally means using packages directly from golang.org rather than what is provided by the distribution package manager. Gogs offers a dead-simple setup and configuration story for new users. There is only the single, gogs binary to worry about (plus the database associated with it).

For running in a production environment, the project has a generic systemd service file available separately. Starting with the 0.6.0 release in March, the main configuration parameters are embedded into the binary, rather than being a separate file. However, it is still possible to override parameters with a customization file.

In my tests, Gogs runs admirably fast, even when importing or cloning a remote Git repository from elsewhere. Naturally, one should expect performance to slow down when dealing with a large number of simultaneous users and repositories, but that may not be a significant problem in reality. Gogs has historically been aimed at people who do not want to host their code on GitHub (prioritizing small installations, Raspberry Pi support, and so on), and has only recently begun tackling enterprise features. So it arguably will not be used by large organizations at all. Large projects or groups looking to build a self-hosted GitHub clone have other options already (GitLab, for example, which emphasizes its large-organization support through features like clustering and scalability).

On the other hand, that distinction makes some of the features prioritized by the Gogs team puzzling. Gogs supports a wealth of social-networking features: users can add multiple email addresses, social media accounts, and personal information to their user account. But surely these features are less important to the average self-hosting developer than gists or the ability to add a project wiki—support for those two features are the subject of multiple feature-requests (and discussions) on the issue tracker. Git itself has built-in support for identifying users by name and email address (data which is automatically picked up by Gogs); in light of that, the choice to built additional "social" features first can be frustrating.

It is hard to know when new features of the functional variety might be expected, since the Gogs team has not formally established a roadmap. But it is possible that outside developers could help fill in some of the gaps. Some of the more interesting features available to projects on GitHub are actually third-party services like the Travis continuous integration system. Gogs supports web hooks for triggering external services; perhaps hooking a self-hosting tool like Gogs up to another system (say, Gerrit) is a better option than trying to re-implement GitHub's code-review features.

But that train of thought can quickly get off track. There is a subset of the free-software community that cares about self-hosting services because they are perceived to be more resilient against privacy invasion and against "friendly" service providers suddenly changing their tune. To really satisfy those goals, however, one would need a project-hosting tool that was completely decentralized and federated.

Gogs is not that tool; if a dozen projects started self-hosting their code on Gogs installations, a user would need to create a dozen separate accounts to file issues or otherwise interact with those projects. It is lamentable, perhaps, but the overhead that requires is part of what makes centralized services look so appealing by contrast.

That issue aside, Gogs does provide a fast and simple way to put a Git-based project repository online and give it a more appealing "front door" than simple web front ends like cgit or gitweb. That will, no doubt, be a valuable service to a great many independent developers or small teams. It has plenty of room to grow; time will tell whether or not it manages to find its own identity or simply provide an easy alternative for GitHub.
