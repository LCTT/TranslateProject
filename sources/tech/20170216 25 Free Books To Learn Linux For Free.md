25 Free Books To Learn Linux For Free
======
Brief: In this article, I'll share with you the best resource to **learn Linux for free**. This is a collection of websites, online video courses and free eBooks.

**How to learn Linux?**

This is perhaps the most commonly asked question in our Facebook group for Linux users.

The answer to this simple looking question 'how to learn Linux' is not at all simple.

Problem is that different people have different meanings of learning Linux.

  * If someone has never used Linux, be it command line or desktop version, that person might be just wondering to know more about it.
  * If someone uses Windows as the desktop but have to use Linux command line at work, that person might be interested in learning Linux commands.
  * If someone has been using Linux for sometimes and is aware of the basics but he/she might want to go to the next level.
  * If someone is just interested in getting your way around a specific Linux distribution.
  * If someone is trying to improve or learn Bash scripting which is almost synonymous with Linux command line.
  * If someone is willing to make a career as a Linux SysAdmin or trying to improve his/her sysadmin skills.



You see, the answer to "how do I learn Linux" depends on what kind of Linux knowledge you are seeking. And for this purpose, I have collected a bunch of resources that you could use for learning Linux.

These free resources include eBooks, video courses, websites etc. And these are divided into sub-categories so that you can easily find what you are looking for when you seek to learn Linux.

Again, there is no **best way to learn Linux**. It totally up to you how you go about learning Linux, by online web portals, downloaded eBooks, video courses or something else.

Let's see how you can learn Linux.

**Disclaimer** : All the books listed here are legal to download. The sources mentioned here are the official sources, as per my knowledge. However, if you find it otherwise, please let me know so that I can take appropriate action.

If you think you know enough about Linux and you are a pro, then why not create your own Linux distribution? Linux From Scratch (LFS) is a project that provides you with step-by-step instructions for building your own custom Linux system, entirely from source code.

Call it DIY Linux but this is a great way to put your Linux expertise to the next level.

There are various sub-parts of this project, you can check it out on its website and download the books from there.

## 4. Distribution specific free learning material

This section deals with material that are dedicated to a certain Linux distribution. What we saw so far was the Linux in general, more focused on file systems, commands and other core stuff.

These books, on the other hand, can be termed as manual or getting started guide for various Linux distributions. So if you are using a certain Linux distribution or planning to use it, you can refer to these resources. And yes, these books are more desktop Linux focused.

I would also like to add that most Linux distributions have their own wiki or documentation section which are often pretty vast. You can always refer to them when you are online.

### Ubuntu Manual

Needless to say that this eBook is for Ubuntu users. It's an independent project that provides Ubuntu manual in the form of free eBook. It is updated for each version of Ubuntu.

The book is rightly called manual because it is basically a composition of step by step instruction and aimed at absolute beginners to Ubuntu. So, you get to know Unity desktop, how to go around it and find applications etc.

It's a must have if you never used Ubuntu Unity because it helps you to figure out how to use Ubuntu for your daily usage.

### Solus Linux Manual [eBook]

Caution! This used to be the official manual from Solus Linux but I cannot find its mentioned on Solus Project's website anymore. I don't know if it's outdated or not. But in any case, a little something about Solu Linux won't really hurt, will it?

[Solus Linux User Guide][25]

## 5. Free eBooks for SysAdmin

This section is dedicated to the SysAdmins, the superheroes for developers. I have listed a few free eBooks here for SysAdmin which will surely help anyone who is already a SysAdmin or aspirs to be one. I must add that you should also focus on essential Linux command lines as it will make your job easier.
