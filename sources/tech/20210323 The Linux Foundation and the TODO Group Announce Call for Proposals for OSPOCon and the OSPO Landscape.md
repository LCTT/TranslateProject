The Linux Foundation and the TODO Group Announce Call for Proposals for OSPOCon and the OSPO Landscape
======

_OSPOCon is an event dedicated to creating better, more efficient open source ecosystems._

**SAN FRANCISCO, March 23, 2020** — [The Linux Foundation][1], the nonprofit organization enabling mass innovation through open source, along with co-host the [TODO Group][2], an open group of organizations who collaborate on practices, tools and other ways to run successful and effective open source programs and projects, has opened its Call for Proposals for [OSPOCon][3].  The event will take place September 29 – October 1 in Dublin, Ireland, alongside [Open Source Summit][4] \+ [Embedded Linux Conference 2021][5]. The TODO Group has also launched an [OSPO Landscape][6] as a resource for the community to learn more about OSPOs. The community is encouraged to contribute to the landscape.

OSPOCon is a new event, dedicated to those working to create a center of competency for open source in their organizations in order to join together to overcome challenges through sharing experiences, best practices, and tooling. [Open Source Program Offices][7] (OSPOs) face many obstacles, such as ensuring high-quality and frequent releases, engaging with developer communities, and contributing back to other projects effectively. Collaborating together with others working on the same concerns helps the entire ecosystem improve.

“I am thrilled to be a part of the inaugural OSPOCon and see it brought to life to support the many hardworking and dedicated people involved in creating and sustaining OSPOs,” said Chris Aniszczyk, co-founder of the TODO Group and CTO at The Linux Foundation. “The impact OSPOs are having grows every day as they become a strategic function for organizations, from companies to governments to research institutions. Their contributions are tremendously valued and we look forward to furthering their abilities to collaborate, grow, and learn from each other.”
