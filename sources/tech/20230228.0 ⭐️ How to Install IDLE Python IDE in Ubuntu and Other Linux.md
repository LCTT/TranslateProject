How to Install IDLE Python IDE in Ubuntu and Other Linux
======

**Python’s default IDE IDLE is not installed by default in Ubuntu and other distros. Learn how to install it in this guide.**

IDLE (**I**ntegrated **D**evelopment and **L**earning **E**nvironment) is a [Python IDE][1], written in Python language itself and usually gets installed in Windows as part of [Python installation][2]. It is ideal for beginners and straightforward to use. For those who are learning Python, such as students, it can be a good IDE to start with.

Basic features such as syntax highlighting, smart ident, and auto-completion are some of the features of this IDE. You can always learn more about the IDLE features in the official [documentation][3].

### IDLE in Ubuntu and other Linux

All Linux distributions, including Ubuntu, come with Python pre-installed. Even if you manually upgrade or install Python versions, the IDLE IDE doesn’t come with that. You have to install it manually.

For **Debian, Ubuntu, Linux Mint and related distribution** open a terminal and run the following command to install IDLE.

```
sudo apt update
```

```
sudo apt install idle3
```

Hit yes when the command asks you whether you want to install IDLE or not. After the command is complete, IDLE will be installed in your Ubuntu system.

For **Fedora, RHEL, CentOS**, use the following command to install it.

```
sudo dnf update
```

```
sudo dnf install idle3
```

**Arch Linux** users can install it using the following command.

```
sudo pacman -S python tk
```

### Launching IDLE and writing a sample program to test

After the installation in Ubuntu, Debian, Linux Mint, and Fedora – you can find the IDLE icon in the application menu. See below.

If you are using Arch Linux, you need to run below from the command line to launch IDLE.

```
idle
```

Once you launch IDLE, you should see the main window, as shown in the image below.

![IDLE editor main window][6]

By default, it shows you a shell where you can directly execute Python codes in each line. It works like any shell interpreter. And when you hit enter, you get the output, and the three “>” symbols go to the next line for the next command.

IDLE also allows you to open any .py file from its file menu. It will open the file in a separate window where you can make changes and run it directly. You can run using F5 or from the option Run > Run Module.

The output is shown in a separate output window. From the output window, you can start debugging, step into a line or file, view stack trace and other options.

### Closing Notes

Now you learned how to install the IDLE IDE in Ubuntu and other distributions and how to run a statement or a Python program. IDLE can be a good starting point for beginners to grasp the basics before heading over to more complex IDEs.

I hope this guide helps you on your Python journey.
