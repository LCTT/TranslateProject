[NXP Semiconductors][5] has unveiled what it calls the world’s smallest and lowest-power 64-bit ARM processor for the Internet of Things (IoT).

The tiny QorIQ LS1012A delivers networking-grade security and performance acceleration to battery-powered, space-constrained applications. This includes powering applications for Internet of Things, or everyday objects that are smart and connected. If IoT is to reach its potential of $1.7 trillion by 2020 (as estimated by market researcher IDC), it’s going to need processors like the new one from NXP, which was unveiled at the Embedded World 2016 event in Nuremberg, Germany.

The chip has a 64-bit ARMv8 processor with network packet acceleration and built-in security. It fits in a 9.6 mm-square space and draws about 1 watt of power. Potential applications include next-generation IoT gateways, portable entertainment platforms, high-performance portable storage applications, mobile hard disk drives, and mobile storage for cameras, tablets, and other rechargeable devices.

Additionally, the LS1012A is the first processor designed specifically for an emerging new storage solution, dubbed object-based storage. Object-based storage relies on a smart hard disk drive that is directly connected to the data center’s Ethernet network. The processor must be small enough to be integrated directly on the circuit board for a hard disk drive.

“The groundbreaking combination of low power, tiny footprint and networking-grade performance of NXP’s LS1012 processor is ideal for consumer, networking and Internet of Things applications alike,” said Tareq Bustami, senior vice president and general manager of NXP’s Digital Networking division, in a statement. “This unique blend of capabilities unleashes embedded systems designers and developers to imagine and create radically innovative end-products across a broad spectrum of high-growth markets.”

NXP said it is the only 1-watt, 64-bit processor in the market to combine such a comprehensive set of high-speed peripherals in a single chip, thus enabling lower system-level costs. And due to innovative packaging, the processor can be routed on low-cost circuit boards.

NXP’s LS1012A will be available in April 2016 and can be ordered now. NXP has more than 45,000 employees in 35 countries.
