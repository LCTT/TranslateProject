Celebrate 30 Years of Linux With Training & Certification Offer
======

On August 25, 1991, Linus Torvalds posted the now famous Usenet message announcing he was building a free operating system. In the 30 years since, that operating system – Linux – has become the most important open source software project in history, powering all supercomputers, serving as the backbone of the cloud and internet, running a majority of mobile phones and mainframe computers, and even operating on the International Space Station.

After all this time Linux is more important than ever. In fact, the [2020 Open Source Jobs Report][1] from The Linux Foundation and edX found that Linux is the most in demand skill amongst technical hiring managers. This is largely due to rapidly growing adoption of cloud technologies which run on Linux. 

To celebrate 30 years of Linux, and to help more individuals become successful, productive members of the Linux community, Linux Foundation Training &amp; Certification is discounting some of our most popular Linux training courses and certification exams through the end of 2021 by 30% with code **LINUX30**, including:
