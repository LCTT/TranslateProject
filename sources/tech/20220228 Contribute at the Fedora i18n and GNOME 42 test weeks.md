Contribute at the Fedora i18n and GNOME 42 test weeks
======

![Fedora Linux Kernel 5.16][1]

There are two upcoming test weeks in the coming weeks. The first is **Monday 28 February through Monday 07 March**. It is to test GNOME 42. The second is **Monday 07 March through Sunday 13 March**. It focuses on testing internationalization. Come and test with us to make the upcoming Fedora 36 even better. Read more below on how to do it.

### GNOME test week

GNOME is the default desktop environment for Fedora Workstation and thus for many Fedora users. As a part of the planned change the GNOME megaupdate will land on Fedora which then will be shipped with Fedora 36. To ensure that everything works fine The Workstation Working Group and QA team will have this test week **Monday 28 February through Monday 07 March**. Refer to the [GNOME test week wiki page][2] for links and resources.

### i18n test week

[i18n test week][3] focuses on testing internationalization features in Fedora Linux. The test week is **March 07 through March 13.**

### How do test days work?

A test day is an event where anyone can help make sure changes in Fedora work well in an upcoming release. Fedora community members [often participate][4], and the public is welcome at these events. If you’ve never contributed before, this is a perfect way to get started.

To contribute, you only need to be able to download test materials (which include some large files) and then read and follow directions step by step.

Detailed information about both test days are on the wiki pages above. If you’re available on or around the days of the events, please do some testing and report your results.

Fedora test days are events where anyone can help make sure changes in Fedora work well in an upcoming release. Fedora community members often participate, and the public is welcome at these events. If you’ve never contributed to Fedora before, this is a perfect way to get started.

Again, The two upcoming test days in the upcoming week are:

  * **Monday 28 February through Monday 07 March**, to test GNOME 42.


  * **Monday 07 March through Sunday 13 March**, focusing on testing internationalization.
