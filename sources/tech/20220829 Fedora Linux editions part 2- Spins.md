One of the nice things about using Linux is the wide choice of desktop environments. Fedora Linux official Worksation edition comes with GNOME as default desktop environment, but you can choose another desktop environment as default via Fedora Spins. This article will go into a little more detail about the Fedora Linux Spins. You can find an overview of all the Fedora Linux variants in my previous article [Introduce the different Fedora Linux editions][4].

### KDE Plasma Desktop

This Fedora Linux comes with KDE Plasma as the default desktop environment. KDE Plasma is an elegant desktop environment that is very easy to customize. Therefore, you can freely and easily change the appearance of your desktop as you wish. You can customize your favorite themes, install the widgets you want, change icons, change fonts, customize panels according to your preferences, and install various extensions from the community.

### SoaS Desktop

SoaS stands for Sugar on a Stick. Fedora Linux Sugar Desktop is a learning platform for children, so it has a very simple interface that is easy for children to understand. The word “stick” in this context refers to a thumb drive or memory “stick”. This means this OS has a compact size and can be completely installed on a thumb drive. Schoolchildren can carry their OS on a thumb drive, so they can use it easily at home, school, library, and elsewhere. Fedora Linux SoaS has a variety of interesting learning applications for children, such as Browse, Get Books, Read, Turtle Blocks, Pippy, Paint, Write, Labyrinth, Physic, and FotoToon.

### i3 Tiling WM

The i3 Tiling WM spin of Fedora Linux is a bit different from the others. This Fedora Linux spin does not use a desktop environment, but only uses a window manager. The window manager used is i3, which is a very popular tiling window manager among Linux users. Fedora i3 Spin is intended for those who focus on interacting using a keyboard rather than pointing devices, such as a mouse or touchpad. This spin of Fedora Linux is equipped with various applications, such as Firefox, NM Applet, brightlight, azote, htop, mousepad, and Thunar.
