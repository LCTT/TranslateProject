Open Source Web Engine Servo to be Hosted at Linux Foundation
======

![][1]

**KubeCon, November 17, 2020 –** The Linux Foundation, the nonprofit organization enabling mass innovation through open source, today announced it will host the [Servo web engine][2]. Servo is an open source, high-performance browser engine designed for both application and embedded use and is written in the [Rust programming language][3], bringing lightning-fast performance and memory safety to browser internals. Industry support for this move is coming from Futurewei, Let’s Encrypt, Mozilla, Samsung, and Three.js, among others.

_“The Linux Foundation’s track record for hosting and supporting the world’s most ubiquitous open source technologies makes it the natural home for growing the Servo community and increasing its platform support,” said Alan Jeffrey, Technical Chair of the Servo project. “There’s a lot of development work and opportunities for our Servo Technical Steering Committee to consider, and we know this cross-industry open source collaboration model will enable us to accelerate the highest priorities for web developers.”_
