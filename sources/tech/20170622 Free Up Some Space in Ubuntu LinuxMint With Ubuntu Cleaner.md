Free Up Some Space in Ubuntu/LinuxMint With Ubuntu Cleaner (Fork of Janitor Module)
============================================================


Most of us very often forget to remove junk files in Linux system which will make the system to run out of space.

We have to follow few stand procedure to free up space (remove distribution cache, system logs, app cache & trash) in Linux distribution, if we are doing the same procedure in manual way it would take hell lots of time and very difficult too.

In Linux verity of applications is available to make this task much easier. Today we are going to teach you about Ubuntu Cleaner which is forked from Janitor module (It’s one of the module in Ubuntu tweak).

[Ubuntu Cleaner][2] is a tool that makes it easy to clean your Ubuntu system. As we already knows Ubuntu Tweak is one of the best utility which help us to tweak Ubuntu and its derivatives. It’s got deprecated as his main developer did not have time to maintain it.

So the developer of Ubuntu Cleaner forked the janitor module from Ubuntu tweak utility and bring back that useful functionality to the Ubuntu community with new name called Ubuntu cleaner since many users using Ubuntu tweak utility in latest version too (as they don’t want to leave the utility). It’s one of the most popular utility on Ubuntu many years.
