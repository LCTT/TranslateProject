FOSS Weekly #24.01: Linux in 2024, GDM Customization, Distros You Missed Last Year
======

New year, ~~new~~ same old me 😄

What do we have in the first edition of FOSS Weekly in 2024? Some year end special articles.

But an important and [surprising development came from Gentoo][1] just before 2023 ended. That could take away the pain of compiling each and every package.

Other than that, I have noted down suggestions from readers like you on topics It's FOSS should cover in 2024. You shall notice the work on those topics this year.

**💬 Let's see what else you get in this edition of FOSS Weekly:**

  * Starting off 2024 with new app/distro releases.
  * GDM login screen customization
  * Year end round ups
  * And other Linux news, videos and, of course, memes!

## 🗓️ Tech Trivia

Will you believe that people bought personal computers just to run a spreadsheet software? Back in 1979, a spreadsheet software, VisiCalc was released for Apple II. People could use personal computer for business thanks to the spreadsheet software. The software sold over 100,000 copies and also boosted the sale of Apple II and forced bigger players like IBM to enter the personal computing market. The company behind VisiCalc, Software Arts, was formed on 2nd January 1979.

By the way, Blender turned 30 on 2nd January. The first release was in 1994.
