2020 Open Source Jobs Report Reveals Spike in Demand for DevOps Talent
======

[![][1]][2]

The Linux Foundation, the nonprofit organization enabling mass innovation through open source, and edX, the trusted platform for learning, has released the 2020 Open Source Jobs Report, examining demand for open source talent and trends amongst open source professionals.

Despite the pandemic, demand for open source technology skills continues to be strong. Companies and organizations continue to increase their recruitment of open source technology talent while offering increased educational opportunities for existing staff to fill skills gaps. 93% of hiring managers report difficulty finding open source talent, and 63% say their organizations have begun to support open source projects with code or other resources for the explicit reason of recruiting individuals with those software skills, a significant jump from the 48% who stated this in 2018. DevOps has also become the top role hiring managers are looking to fill (65% are looking to hire DevOps talent), moving demand for developers to second (59%) for the first time in this report’s history. 74% of employers are now offering to pay for employee certifications, up from 55% in 2018, 47% in 2017, and only 34% in 2016.
