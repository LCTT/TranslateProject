Vimix is an Open Source Tool That Helps With Graphical Mixing and Blending Live
======

There are several [Linux tools available for digital artists][1]. However, those are mostly for image manipulation or drawing.

So, how can you blend and mix video clips or computer-generated graphics in real-time on Linux?

This is mostly a use-case if you are presenting something live for a VJ session or concerts and conferences.

vimix sounds like a tool that can come in handy for the job.

Of course, [video editors][3] should be preferred if you want to edit a video and apply several post-processing effects.

But, if you want real-time video clip manipulation for a good extent, vimix is a tool that you can try. It is an open-source tool which also happens to be the successor of [GLMixer][4] which is no longer maintained.

Here, I will highlight some of the key features that it offers.

### Features of vimix

![][5]

You get a huge set of abilities with this tool. If you are new to using such a tool, this could prove to be overwhelming.

  * Mixing multiple video clips
  * Controlling opacity using a simple slider for multiple active clips
  * Fade videos to apply smooth transition when playing multiple videos as a cross-playlist
  * Folder-based session
  * Geometry feature to manipulate/re-size source clips
  * Incredibly useful layer option to add three or more videos at a time
  * Apply post-processing effects to computer-generated graphics
  * Multiple blending modes
  * Ability to clone sources
  * Tweak the texture of the sources
  * Multiple cropping options



### Install vimix on Linux

It is only available as a snap package right now. So, if you want to install it on any Linux distribution of your choice, download it from the [Snap store][6] or your software center if it has integrated snap enabled.

```
sudo snap install vimix
```

You can also refer to our [snap guide][7] if you need help to set it up. If interesting, you can compile it yourself or explore more about it in its [GitHub page][8].

### Closing Thoughts

vimix is a tool that caters the need of specific use-cases. And, that is what it excels at.

It is good to see the availability of such a tool tailored for live video jockeys and other professionals using Linux.

It is worth noting that I’m not an expert to work with this tool, so I just fiddled around with the common operations to control opacity, fade videos, and add effects to the source.

I encourage you to explore more, and please don’t hesitate to let me know your thoughts in the comments below!
