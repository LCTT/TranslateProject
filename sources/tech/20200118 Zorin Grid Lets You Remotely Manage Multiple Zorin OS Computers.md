Zorin Grid Lets You Remotely Manage Multiple Zorin OS Computers
======

One of the major hurdles institutes face is in managing and updating multiple Linux systems from a central point.

Well, Zorin OS has come up with a new cloud-based tool that will help you manage multiple computers running Zorin OS from one single interface. You can update the systems, install apps and configuration all systems remotely using this tool called [Zorin Grid][1].

### Zorin Grid: Manage a fleet of Zorin OS computers remotely

**Zorin Grid is a tool that makes it simple to set up, manage, and secure a fleet of Zorin OS-powered computers in businesses, schools, and organizations.**

When it comes to managing Linux distributions (here, Zorin OS) on a multitude of systems for an organization – it is quite time-consuming.

If it will be easier to manage Linux systems, more organizations will be interested to switch using Linux just like the [Italian city Vicenza replaced Windows by Zorin OS][3].

For the very same reason, the Zorin team decided to create ‘**Zorin Grid**‘ with the help of which every school, enterprises, organizations, and businesses will be able to easily manage their Zorin OS-powered machines.

### Zorin Grid features

![Zorin Grid Features][4]

You might have guessed what it is capable of – but let me highlight the key features of Zorin Grid as per its official webpage:

  * Install and Remove Apps
  * Set software update and security patch policies
  * Monitor computer status
  * Enforce security policies
  * Keep track of software and hardware inventory
  * Set desktop settings
  * Organize computers into groups (for teams and departments)
  * Role-based access control and audit logging



In addition to these, you will be able to do a couple more things using the Zorin Grid service. But, it looks like most of the essential tasks will be covered by Zorin Grid.

### How does Zorin Grid work?

Zorin Grid is a cloud based software as a service. Zorin will be charging a monthly subscription fee for each computer managed by Zorin Grid in an organization.

You’ll have to install the Zorin Grid client on all the systems that you want to manage. Since it is cloud-based, you can manage all the Zorin systems on your grid from a web browser by logging into you Zorin Grid account.

You choose how to configure the computers once and the Zorin Grid applies the same configuration to all or specific computers in your organization.

The price has not been finalized. [Artyom Zorin][6], **CEO of Zorin Group, told It’s FOSS** that schools and non-profit organizations will get Zorin Grid for a reduced pricing.

While client-side software for Zorin Grid will be open source, the Zorin Grid server won’t be open source initially. Releasing it under an open source license is _tentatively_ on their roadmap.

Artyom also told that they **plan to support other Linux distributions starting with Ubuntu and Ubuntu-based distros** after launching Zorin Grid for Zorin OS systems this summer.

In case you decide to migrate from Windows to Zorin OS for your organization or business, you will find a [useful migration guide][7] by the Zorin OS team to help you switch to Linux.

**Wrapping Up**

Let me summarize all the important points about Zorin Grid:

  * Zorin Grid is an upcoming cloud based service that lets you manage multiple Zorin OS systems.
  * It’s a premium service that charges for each computer used. The pricing is not determined yet.
  * Educational institutes and non-profit organizations can get Zorin Grid for a reduced pricing.
  * Initially it can only handle Zorin OS. Other Ubuntu-based distributions are on the road-map but there is no definite timeline for that.
  * The service should be available in the summer 2020.
  * Zorin Grid server won’t be open source initially.



Zorin Grid looks to be an impressive premium tool for organizations or businesses that want to use Linux while also being able to maintain their systems easily.

Personally, I wouldn’t mind paying for the service if it makes deploying and using Linux easier, in general.

Of course, it does not support every Linux distro as of yet – but it is indeed a promising service to keep an eye out for.

What do you think about it? Do you know of a better alternative to Zorin Grid? Do share your views in the comments.
