SODA Foundation Announces 2021 Data & Storage Trends Survey
======

Data and storage technologies are evolving. The [SODA Foundation][1] is conducting a survey to identify the current challenges, gaps, and trends for data and storage in the era of cloud-native, edge, AI, and 5G. Through new insights generated from the data and storage community at large, end-users will be better equipped to make decisions, vendors can improve their products, and the SODA Foundation can establish new technical directions — and beyond!

The SODA Foundation is an open source project under Linux Foundation that aims to foster an ecosystem of open source data management and storage software for data autonomy. SODA Foundation offers a neutral forum for cross-project collaboration and integration and provides end-users quality end-to-end solutions. We intend to use this survey data to help guide the SODA Foundation and its surrounding ecosystem on important issues.

Please participate now; we intend to close the survey in late May. 

Privacy and confidentiality are important to us. Neither participant names, nor their company names, will be displayed in the final results. 

The first 50 survey respondents will each receive a $25 (USD) Amazon gift card. Some conditions apply.

This survey should take no more than 15 minutes of your time.

### SURVEY GOALS

Thank you for taking the time to participate in this survey conducted by SODA Foundation, an open source project at the Linux Foundation focusing on data management and storage.

This survey will provide insights into the challenges, gaps, and trends for data and storage in the era of cloud-native, edge, AI, and 5G. We hope these insights will help end-users make better decisions, enable vendors to improve their products and serve as a guide to the technical direction of SODA and the surrounding ecosystem.

This survey will provide insights into:

  * What are the data &amp; storage challenges faced by end-users?
  * Which features and capabilities do end users look for in data and storage solutions?
  * What are the key trends shaping the data &amp; storage industry?
  * Which open source data &amp; storage projects are users interested in?
  * What cloud strategies are businesses adopting?
