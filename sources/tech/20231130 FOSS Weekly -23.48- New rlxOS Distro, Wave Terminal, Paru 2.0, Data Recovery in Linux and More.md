FOSS Weekly #23.48: New rlxOS Distro, Wave Terminal, Paru 2.0, Data Recovery in Linux and More
======

A modern Linux terminal I discovered this week took me by surprise. I was not expecting it to be this different!

It's like VS Code or a modern code editor. It is aimed primarily at developers but people who are not comfortable with traditional terminals would also be happy with it.
