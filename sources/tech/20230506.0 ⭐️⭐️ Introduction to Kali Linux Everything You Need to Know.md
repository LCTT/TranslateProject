At the core, Kali Linux is built upon the [Debian-testing][2] branch and is specially designed for network analysts, penetration testers, and cybersecurity professionals. Kali Linux is a Debian-derived Linux distribution maintained by Offensive Security, developed by Mati Aharoni and Devon Kearns.

It comes with a comprehensive set of pre-installed tools that are used for various security testing purposes. It is an open-source operating system that is freely available to download and use.

### History

Kali Linux was initially released in March 2013 as a successor to BackTrack Linux. BackTrack was a popular Linux distribution that was widely used for penetration testing and digital forensics. It was created by Offensive Security, a cybersecurity company that specializes in information security training and penetration testing services. Since its initial release, Kali Linux has undergone many updates and improvements to become the most popular Linux distribution for security workloads.
