### 10 Necessary GNOME Apps

#### Secrets – Password Manager

The first app that we highlight is a password manager called Secrets. This GNOME Circle app uses KeePass 0.4 format to store the password in its database. This app comes with a simple interface that gives you complete control of your password and managing them. Secret perfectly integrates with your GNOME desktop, which you can install.

#### Font Downloader

Installing font via terminal for new users is a bit complicated process. The next app that we are going to talk about deals with Fonts. And it is one of my favourites. The name is Font Downloader, and it does just that.

But this app takes care of all the hassles that an average faces. You can search fonts in Google Fonts directly from its UI and install it with just a click of a button. A perfect and necessary GNOME app for your desktop.

Here’s how to install it.

#### Gaphor – UML Modeling Utility

Out of all the GNOME apps we have covered so far, this one is one of the best apps. Named Gaphor, this application helps you design complex systems via Unified Modelling Language. It currently supports UML, SysML, RAAML and C4 languages and is fully compliant with the [UML 2 data model][23].

It is a perfect GNOME app for students or system design professionals.

#### Hashbrown – Check Hash of your files

I will be honest. I download many .ISO files for this website and several tests. And I rarely check the hash of any file. However, I do check them when downloaded from unofficial websites.

So, a hash is a way to verify whether your downloaded file is original or not. If someone tampered with the file, then it won’t match. So, there are many ways you can do it.

This GNOME App – Hashbrown, does that job for you. Its unique and straightforward UI helps you to compare several hash types of a file. This app currently supports MD5, SHA-256, SHA-512 and SHA-1 hashes. A perfect and necessary utility for your GNOME desktop.

![Hashbrown – GNOME App][29]

You need to [Setup Flatpak][15] for your Linux distribution. And then click on the below button to launch the native software manager to install (such as Software or Discover).

#### Identity – Compare images and videos

If you need to compare multiple images or video files, you should use Identity. This GNOME app compares and gives you information about the target files. Powered by GStreamer, Identity also comes with the command line utility to compare the files.

#### Khronos – Time Logging

If you ever need an on-demand timer that keeps track of time while you complete your task, then try Khronos. This GNOME Circle app brings a simple UI, adds a timer, and starts. You can keep track of multiple sessions in a log, as well as the ability to pause and start at any moment.

It is a friendly GNOME app for those who need it.

#### Markets – Watch Stock Markets

I am sure you keep track of your favourite stocks or overall investment portfolio in the stock market via browser-based portals. But if you need a native desktop application to do those and more for your GNOME desktop, try Markets.

Markets is a GNOME Circle app, and it brings a list of cool features to track stocks and helps you stay in profits. Features such as –

  * Individual Stock tracking
  * Create your portfolio
  * Track Cryptocurrencies, commodities
  * Details via Yahoo! finance
  * Supported in Linux-based smartphones (Librem5, PinePhone)
  * Adjust refresh rate and Dark Mode Support

#### Obfuscate – Redact Images

We often need to gray out or remove certain sensitive sections of any image for obvious reasons. So, that requires you to open the image in some image editor such as GIMP and then apply some filters.

If you think that is too much work, try Obfuscate native app for GNOME. This GNOME Circle app helps you redact custom sections from any image and export them. This app supports all major image types. However, you can do these using LibreOffice, which requires inserting an image to the Writer document and whatnot. Try it out.

![Obfuscate – GNOME App][46]

You need to [Setup Flatpak][15] for your Linux distribution. And then click on the below button to launch the native software manager to install (such as Software or Discover).

#### Plots – Simple Graph Plotting

If you need a quick tool to visualize those complex math formulae in nice graphs, then try Plots. This GNOME Circle app integrates well with GNOME Desktop and allows you to plot a wide range of charts or graphs.

Here are some of its unique features:

  * Support for trigonometric, hyperbolic, exponential and logarithmic functions, as well as arbitrary sums and products
  * Ability to utilize your system hardware with the support of OpenGL
  * Color Support for graphs
Easy customization of graphs with the value bar which you can increase or decrease interactively to see the graphs

#### squeekboard – On-screen keyboard for wayland

The final app in this post is for only Linux mobile phones. I thought it was worth mentioning this app because of Wayland. The squeekboard is an on-screen keyboard designed for Librem5 Linux Smartphones for Wayland compositor. This GTK and Rust based application is currently under development, but most of the essential features are already implemented.

You can learn more about it in [GitLab][54]. I couldn’t find a screenshot to share with you. However, if you are interested, try it out.
