### How to Perform The Upgrade from Debian 9 (Stretch) to Debian 10 (Buster)?

Upgrading the Debian system (Debian based systems as well) is an easy and painless task. It can be done through **[APT Package Manager][2]**.

To do so, follow the below procedures. Make sure that your current Debian system is up-to-date.

Update your existing software to latest available version using the following commands.

### Step-1:

Refresh the repositories index by running the following command.

```
$ sudo apt update
```

Run the following command to install the available updates on system.

```
$ sudo apt upgrade
```

Run the following command to perform the available minor upgrade with in version.

```
$ sudo apt full-upgrade
```

By default, it will remove obsolete packages by running the above command. However, i advise you to run the below commands.

```
$ sudo apt autoremove

$ sudo apt clean
```

You may need to reboot the system, if a new kernel is installed. If so, run the following command.

```
$ sudo shutdown -r now
```

Finally check the currently installed version.

```
$ lsb_release -a

No LSB modules are available.
Distributor ID: Debian
Description:    Debian GNU/Linux 9.9 (stretch)
Release:        9.9
Codename:       stretch
```

### Step-2: Update/Modify the /etc/apt/sources.list file

After reboot, modify the sources.list file and point from Debian 9 (Stretch) to Debian 10 (Buster).

First backup the below config files using the **[cp command][3]**.

```
$ sudo cp  /etc/apt/sources.list /root
$ sudo cp -r /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ /root
```

Modify the “sources.list” file and point to Debian 10 (Buster).

```
$ sudo sed -i 's/stretch/buster/g' /etc/apt/sources.list
$ sudo sed -i 's/stretch/buster/g' /etc/apt/sources.list.d/*
```

Refresh the repositories index by running the following command.

```
$ sudo apt update
```

Run the following command to install the available updates on system. During the upgrade you may need to confirm for service restart and config file replace so, just follow on-screen instructions.

The upgrade may take some time depending on the number of updates and your Internet speed.

```
$ sudo apt upgrade
```

Run the following command to perform a complete upgrade of the system.

```
$ sudo apt full-upgrade
```

By default, the above command will remove obsolete packages. However, i advise you to run the below commands once again.

```
$ sudo apt autoremove

$ sudo apt clean
```

Finally reboot the system to boot with Debian 10 Buster.

```
$ sudo shutdown -r now
```

The upgraded Debian version can be verified by running the following command.

```
$ lsb_release -a

No LSB modules are available.
Distributor ID: Debian
Description:    Debian GNU/Linux 10 (buster)
Release:        10
Codename:       buster
```
