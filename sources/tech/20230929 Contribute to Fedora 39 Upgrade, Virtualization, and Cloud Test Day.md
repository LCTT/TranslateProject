Contribute to Fedora 39 Upgrade, Virtualization, and Cloud Test Day
======

![test days][1]

Fedora test days are events where anyone can help make certain that changes in Fedora work well in an upcoming release. Fedora community members often participate, and the public is welcome at these events. If you’ve never contributed to Fedora before, this is a perfect way to get started.

There are three test days occurring in the next two weeks covering three topics:

  * **Tuesday October 03** , is to test the **Fedora Cloud**
  * **Thursday October 05** , is to test the **Fedora Upgrade**
  * **Monday October 09** , is to test **Virtualization**



Come and test with us to make Fedora 39 even better. Read more below on how to do it.

### Fedora Cloud test day

Fedora Linux 39 is coming close to the release date and the Fedora Cloud SIG would like to get the community together to find and squash some bugs.

The test day will occur on **Tuesday October 03**. This event will test Fedora Cloud Base content. See the [wiki page][2] for links to the Beta Cloud Base Images. We have qcow, AMI, and ISO images ready for testing.

### Upgrade test day

As we come closer to Fedora Linux 39 release dates, it’s time to test upgrades. This release has a lot of [changes][3] and it becomes essential that we test the graphical upgrade methods as well as the command line methods.

This test day will happen on **Thursday, October 05**. It will test upgrading from a full updated F37 and F38 to F39 for all architectures (x86_64, ARM, aarch64) and variants (WS, cloud, server, silverblue, IoT). See this [wiki page][4] for information and details.

### Virtualization test day

This test day will happen on **Monday, October 09** and will test all forms of virtualization possible in Fedora. The [test day][5] will focus on testing Fedora or your favorite distro inside a bare metal implementation of Fedora running Boxes, KVM, VirtualBox and whatever you have. The general features of installing the OS and working with it are outlined in the test cases which you will find on the [results][6] page.

### How do test days work?

A test day is an event where anyone can help make certain that changes in Fedora work well in an upcoming release. Fedora community members [often participate][7], and the public is welcome at these events. Test days are the perfect way to start contributing if you not in the past.

The only requirement to get started is the ability to download test materials (which include some large files) and then read and follow directions step by step.

Detailed information about all the test days are on the wiki page links provided above. If you are available on or around the days of the events, please do some testing and report your results.
