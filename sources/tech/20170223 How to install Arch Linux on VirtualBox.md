Arch Linux is a Linux-based operating system that is designed for i689 and 86-64 computers. Its unique package manager is responsible for providing updates to the latest software applications using “pacman” with complete tracking. Pacman is the package manager that is used to install, update, and remove the software packages. It is designed entirely for free and open-source software, along with the support from the Linux community.

Arch Linux is also popular for having a comprehensive documentation in form of the community wiki known as ArchWiki. This Linux operating system is based on binary packages that are targeted for i832, 64-bit, and 32-bit systems and optimized for the best performance on the modern hardware systems.

You can install Arch Linux directly to your home computer by following this guide but you can also install it on a virtual machine on your Windows computer by using VirtualBox.

### Arch Linux Repositories

To install Arch Linux on Virtual Box, you must know the basic repositories of this Linux-based operating system. A repository is a storage location from where the software packages are retrieved during the installation process. There are multiple repositories available for Arch Linux, which are accessible via pacman and maintained by package maintainers. Here is a list of some of the basic repositories used to install Arch Linux on Virtual Box:

*   The **core **repository contains all the packages that are needed to setup the base system like booting Arch Linux, and building packages.

*   The **extra **repository contains extra packages that do not fit in the core involving desktop environment.

*   The **community **repositoryhas packages that are adopted by trusted Linux community users, and most of them will transfer to the core or extra repository.

*   The **Multilib **repository contains 32-bit software and libraries for 32-bit application installation on 64-bit system.

*   The **testing **repository contains packages that are destined for core or extra repositories.

*   The **community-testing** repository is for the Linux community.

*   The **multilib testing **repositoryis similar to the testing repository, but for multilib candidates.

*   The **gnome-unstable **repository has the latest GNOME desktop environment.

*   The **kde-unstable **repository contains the latest KDE software before they are been released.
