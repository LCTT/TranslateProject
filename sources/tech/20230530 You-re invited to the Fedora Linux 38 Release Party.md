You’re invited to the Fedora Linux 38 Release Party!
======

![][1]

Join the Fedora community this weekend on Friday, June 2nd and Saturday, June 3rd to celebrate the final release of Fedora Linux 38 with a virtual [Release Party][2]. Please [**register on Hopin**][3] and join us on June 2nd & 3rd for a short program of informational sessions and social activities. Make sure to save the dates, share the registration, and show up to celebrate with Fedora Friends, old and new!

The [schedule for the Release Party][4] features informational sessions about the [rewritten Fedora Notifications service][5], a [Creative Freedom Summit retrospective][6], [Fedora CoreOS][7], updates from the [EPEL][8] and [Fedora Docs][9] teams, and more community activities. Last, but certainly not least, we will be hanging out in the [Fedora Museum WorkAdventure][10] for our Hallway track. Thanks to our amazing community for all your contributions to the latest release of Fedora Linux. Let’s party!
