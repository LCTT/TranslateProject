Browse Faster With Brave! The First Stable Release is Here
======

[Brave][1] browser is an interesting take as a privacy-focused browser. Even though we already have plenty of options to consider for Linux (Chromium/Firefox, etc.), the Brave browser stands out for things like strictly blocking ads and trackers.

It was in the beta phase before the [announcement][2]. So, if you already had it installed, you may not find a significant change with this release.

If you are learning about this browser for the first time, I shall mention a few key highlights associated with this release.

### Chromium-based Open Source Browser

Yes, Brave is based on Chromium and it’s an open-source browser as well. You can follow its development on [GitHub][4] as well.

If you’re not a fan of Chromium-based browsers, you may check out the list of [non-Google browsers][5] here.

### Ad-blocking Feature &amp; Privacy-friendly Ad Platform

![][6]

Brave focuses on protecting privacy by blocking advertisements, trackers, and also tries to introduce a way to display privacy-respecting advertisements.

Of course, only if you opt-in, you will be displayed advertisements that do not track you or collect any information.

### Rewarding Users &amp; Publishers

Brave integrates a blockchain-based advertising model so that when you opt-in for the privacy-friendly advertisements, you will earn BAT tokens (a.k.a _[Basic Attention Tokens][7]_) which you can then spend to [reward the publishers][8] you love to read, like us :)

In that way, you get to get rid of the data collecting advertisements while also being able to support the publishers.

Even though this advertising model isn’t a big success but the CEO of Brave Software (Brendan Eich), shared his concern for this by mentioning:

“_Either we all accept the $330 billion ad-tech industry treating us as their products, exploiting our data, piling on more data breaches and privacy scandals, and starving publishers of revenue; or we reject the surveillance economy and replace it with something better that works for everyone. That’s the inspiration behind Brave,_”

### Cross-platform

We have an article on how to [install brave on Linux][9] – in case you’re curious. And, yes, along with the support for Linux, you can install it on your Windows/macOS machine as well as on your smartphones.

[Brave browser][1]

If you’re using Chrome/Chromium, the transition to Brave browser should be easy. If you try Brave, don’t forget to share your experience with it.
