### Perfect and Best GNOME Apps – Part 2

#### Flatseal – Managing Flatpak App Permissions

This GNOME App is perfect for heavy users of Flatpak Apps. The Flatpak apps runs in sandbox mode by design. That means, they do not have access to the host system components by default. For example, one Flatpak app may not have access to your Wi-Fi, Or, home directory. But what if an app gives you a nice GUI to manage all the accesses for installed Flatpak apps?

Flatseal does just that. It lists your installed Flatpak apps and gives you nice UI to grant or remove access to all the flatpak apps. This easy to use app is a must-have if you are using GNOME Desktop.

Here’s how it looks and installation steps.
