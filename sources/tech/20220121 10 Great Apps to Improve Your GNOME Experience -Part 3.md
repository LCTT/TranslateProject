### Great GNOME Apps – Part 3

#### Sysprof – System Profiler

The first app we highlight is called sysprof. This is mostly developer specific application that gives you system performance details for Linux Kernel and other user-space applications. With this application, you can identify the threads, stacks, their individual performances, object types and a good deal of other information. Armed with this information, a developer can easily debug and find out the problems in their respective application.

This is a GNOME Circle app and well maintained.

![Sysprof – GNOME Apps][14]

This application does not come with Flatpak executable module. So, you have to compile and build using Kernel Headers for your system. You can find the detailed steps outlined in the below links.

However, scheduling backups is under development, and we hope it soon arrives.

#### Telegrand – Telegram Client

The final app in this list is Telegrand. This application is not stable at the moment and under development. However, I feel it is worth mentioning here because of its potential. The Telegram messaging app have its own native desktop application. However, this GTK based Telegrand act perfectly for your desktop with its features.

There is no installer available at the moment. But you can easily build it from source via instructions present in [GitHub][54].

We hope to see this app become stable in near future and available in GNOME Desktop as well as in GNU/Linux Phones.
