### Create a simple wallpaper with Fedora and Inkscape

 ![inkscape-wallpaper](https://cdn.fedoramagazine.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/inkscape-wallpaper-945x400.png) 

In our previous two Inkscape articles, we have [covered the basics of using Inkscape, creating objects,][18] and [doing some basic manipulations and color changes.][17]

In this next installment, we are going to put all these new skills together, and create our first composition — a simple wallpaper.

### Changing the document size

When going through the previous tutorials, you probably noticed the default document size shown on the main canvas window as a black bordered rectangle. The default document size in Inkscape is the A4 paper size:

][16]

For this wallpaper, we are going to resize the the document to **1024px x 768px**. To change the document size, Go to `File` > `Document Properties…` . In the Custom Size section of the Document Properties dialog, enter the width of 1024px, and a height of 768px:

][15]

The document outline on the page should now look something like this:

][14]

### Drawing the background

Next up, we are going to draw a rectangle as big as the document. So choose the using **rectangle tool, ** draw a rectangle, and adjust the size of the rectangle using the Tools Control bar.

][13]

Next up, add a Gradient Fill to the rectangle. [If you need a refresher on adding gradients, check out the previous adding colours article.][12]

][11]

Your rectangle might also have a stroke colour set. Use the fill and stroke dialog to set the stroke paint to **none**.

][10]

### Drawing the pattern

Next we are going to draw a triangle. Use the star / polygon tool with 3 points. You can** PRESS and HOLD DOWN CTRL** key, to give your triangle an angle and symmetry.

[

][9]

Select the triangle and press **CTRL+D**, to duplicate it (the duplicated figure will overlap the existing one), **so be sure to move it after duplicating.**

[

][8]

Select one of the triangles as shown, and go to **OBJECT > FLIP-HORIZONTAL**

 ![Screenshot from 2016-09-07 09-57-42](https://1504253206.rsc.cdn77.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Screenshot-from-2016-09-07-09-57-42.png) 
][6]

Recolour your three triangles to three colors that look good with your background.

][5]

Select all your triangles, and duplicate them again to fill out your pattern:

[

][4]

### Exporting your background

Finally, we need to export our document as a PNG file. Open up the export dialog with** FILE > EXPORT PNG**, select the file location and name, make sure the Drawing  tab is pressed, and click on **EXPORT**

Let no tool be a barrier to your imagination. Come up with beautiful wallpapers and submit the designs for [FEDORA 25 wallpapers][2]. Your design might get lucky enough to be used by thousands of Fedora users. Here are some examples of wallpapers created with Inkscape and the techniques above:
