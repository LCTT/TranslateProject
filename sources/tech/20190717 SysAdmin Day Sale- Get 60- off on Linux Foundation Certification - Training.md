SysAdmin Day Sale: Get 60% off on Linux Foundation Certification & Training
======

The last Friday of July is celebrated as Sysadmin Day. It’s an annual event created to appreciate the works and efforts of the system administrators.

The [Linux Foundation][1] is the official organization behind the Linux project. It employs the creator of Linux kernel [Linus Torvalds][2].

The Linux Foundation puts a lot of effort in giving direction to Linux and its associated projects, mainly enterprise oriented. One of these projects is to provide [training and certifications in Linux related cutting edge technologies][3].

Usually, these training and certifications cost anywhere around $600 but on the occasion of the Sysadmin Day, you can get them at a heavily discounted price.

### Make your career with Sysadmin Day Sale from the Linux Foundation

![][5]

To celebrate Sysadmin Day, starting July 16th [Linux Foundation is offering all of their IT certification and prep course bundles][6] for only $325 each (instead of ~$600)!

That’s not it. You’ll also get a bonus course, regularly priced at $299, for free with each bundle. So instead of paying about $900, you get everything for $325.

![Linux Foundation Ball Cap][7]

Wait a sec! Let me share a secret with you so that you can save a few more dollars. If you **use the coupon code FOSS16 at checkout time**, you get **additional 16% off on this price**. That’s additional saving of $52.

In the end, you’ll pay only $273 instead of $900. I have lost count of savings at this stage. It surely is more than 60%.

And if that was not good enough, you’ll also get a Linux Foundation ball cap. I would have preferred a Tux cap but this one do as well.

Please do note that the residents of Iran, Iraq, Libya, North Korea, Sudan, Syria, Myanmar and Serbia are not eligible for this promotion.

The sale ends on 26th July i.e. the Sysadmin Day.
