个头小本事大：13 种 20 美元以下的树莓派 Zero 替代品
======

最近两年，[树莓派 Zero][1] 和 [树莓派 Zero W][2] 作为新成员出现在树莓派产品线中。从制造者和 DIY 社区的角度，这些超小型的单板计算机带来了巨大震撼，而且作为 [树莓派计划][3] 的一部分将持续相当一段时间。

为了实现更小尺寸和有效控制价位，他们不得不在许多特性上做出让步，如放弃专用网口、采用更慢的处理器等（与其对应的全功能版相比）。

早先的一篇文章中，我们罗列了 [树莓派的最佳替代品][4]。这里，我将给出树莓派 Zero 和树莓派 Zero W 的一些替代选项。

### 树莓派 Zero 替代品：应用于物联网和嵌入式项目的超小单板计算机

![][9]

受益于开源设计和开源软件栈，在满足各式项目需求的过程中，我们都有大量的各样特性的现成产品可用。所有这些板子运行的都是嵌入式 Linux 的各种变体。

尽管树莓派 Zero 和树莓派 Zero W 发布价格分别是 5 美元和 10 美元，但即使是在美国境内，也很难以发布价买到成品。在美国之外，更是要花 12 和 20 美元才有可能买到。

先记着这些，然后看看一些 20 美元以下的树莓派 Zero 替代品。

#### 1\. 香蕉派 BPI M2 Zero

#### 8\. NanoPi Neo LTS

![][38]

Starting at **$9**.**99**, this board is very simple and tiny(4cm x 4cm), a similar form factor as the Orange Pi Zero. Unlike the Orange Pi Zero it is powered by the more powerful Allwinner H3 SoC and upto 512MB of RAM. It does not feature any onboard WiFi/BT chipset but you can add one via the USB port. This is a really good board to run headless Linux servers, DNS filters like Pi-Hole and it’ll make a really good edge device for any IoT Applications. Using the GPIO you can expand the functionality to match your needs.

#### 13\. VoCore2

![][55]

The VoCore2 is definitely the smallest of the bunch, the bare-bones module is only 1″x1″ in size and costs **$17.99**. The tiny size makes it easy to embed in different applications and allows selective expansion of features based on the need. It is powered by the MediaTek MT7628 which was specially designed for low to mid-range routers. The manufacturer claims that they’ll keep up the production till 2025 which is really good.

**Key Specifications**

  * MediaTek MT7628, 580 MHz, MIPS 24K
  * 128MB RAM, DDR2 166MHz
  * Ethernet – 1 port/5 ports, up to 100Mbps

You can get more information about the board from [here][56] and pick one up from their [official website][57].

**W**r**apping up**

It’s undeniable that there are all kinds of SBC’s available in various form factors and feature sets for a wide variety of use cases. On top of that most of these are open source designs and run on open source software. An absolute wonderland for a hardcore tinkerer.

With COVID-19 hanging around it might be a little tough to get your hands on these boards. Let’s hope things get better soon!

If you guys know of any other interesting alternatives for the Raspberry Pi Zero and Zero W put them in the comments below and we’ll check them out.
