Tiny Yet Useful: 13 Raspberry Pi Zero Alternatives That Cost Less Than $20
======

The [Raspberry Pi Zero][1] and the [Raspberry Pi Zero W][2] were added to the line up of Raspberry Pi’s in the last few years. These ultra-small form-factor SBC’s have been a big hit and continue to be a part of [Raspberry Pi projects][3] from the maker and DIY communities.

Due to the smaller form factor and the prices these boards are targeting, they have had to cut down on many features like a dedicated Ethernet port, slower processor (compared to their full-fledged cousins).

In an earlier article, we listed the [best alternatives to Raspberry Pi][4]. In this one, I’ll list some alternatives to Raspberry Pi Zero and Zero W.

### Alternative to Raspberry Pi Zero: Tiny single board computers for IoT and Embedded Projects

![][9]

We have great alternatives with variety of feature sets for different projects, thanks to open source designs and open source software stacks. All the boards in this round up run embedded Linux in various flavors.

Even though the Raspberry Pi Zero was released at $5 and the Zero W at $10, it’s often very hard to find them at those prices even in US. Outside US they usually cost around $12 – $20 .

Keeping that in mind let’s take a look at some of the alternatives for the Raspberry Pi Zero boards for under $20.

#### 1\. Banana Pi BPI M2 Zero

![][10]

The Banana Pi M2 Zero at **$18** is has the same layout as a Raspberry Pi Zero W. It looks like a clone of the Pi Zero W but other than the form factor it is anything but a clone. It has a faster Allwinner H2+ SOC at its heart and Ethernet can be added externally . It can also run a variety of Linux based operating systems.

**Key Specifications**

  * Allwinner H2+ Quad-core Cortex-A7 H265/HEVC 1080P with Mali400MP2 for the GPU

#### 8\. NanoPi Neo LTS

![][38]

Starting at **$9**.**99**, this board is very simple and tiny(4cm x 4cm), a similar form factor as the Orange Pi Zero. Unlike the Orange Pi Zero it is powered by the more powerful Allwinner H3 SoC and upto 512MB of RAM. It does not feature any onboard WiFi/BT chipset but you can add one via the USB port. This is a really good board to run headless Linux servers, DNS filters like Pi-Hole and it’ll make a really good edge device for any IoT Applications. Using the GPIO you can expand the functionality to match your needs.

**Key Specifications**

  * Allwinner H3 Quad Core Cortex A7 upto 1.2GHz

![][42]

There is also a WiFi/BT version of the NanoPi NEO called the NanoPi NEO Air which also adds eMMC and camera input and lets go of the onboard USB and Ethernet ports. You can check it out [here][43].

#### 9\. Zero Pi

![][44]

This is one of my favorite boards from this round up, it costs **$9.99** and has a fast 1Gbps Ethernet onboard. With the Allwinner H3 at its heart, this can be a very powerful and tiny machine on your network. It supports OpenWRT which is great considering the 1Gbps Ethernet. You can easily run multiple instances of Pi-Hole along with a DNS Server.

#### 13\. VoCore2

![][55]

The VoCore2 is definitely the smallest of the bunch, the bare-bones module is only 1″x1″ in size and costs **$17.99**. The tiny size makes it easy to embed in different applications and allows selective expansion of features based on the need. It is powered by the MediaTek MT7628 which was specially designed for low to mid-range routers. The manufacturer claims that they’ll keep up the production till 2025 which is really good.

**Key Specifications**

  * MediaTek MT7628, 580 MHz, MIPS 24K
  * 128MB RAM, DDR2 166MHz
  * Ethernet – 1 port/5 ports, up to 100Mbps

You can get more information about the board from [here][56] and pick one up from their [official website][57].

**W**r**apping up**

It’s undeniable that there are all kinds of SBC’s available in various form factors and feature sets for a wide variety of use cases. On top of that most of these are open source designs and run on open source software. An absolute wonderland for a hardcore tinkerer.

With COVID-19 hanging around it might be a little tough to get your hands on these boards. Let’s hope things get better soon!
