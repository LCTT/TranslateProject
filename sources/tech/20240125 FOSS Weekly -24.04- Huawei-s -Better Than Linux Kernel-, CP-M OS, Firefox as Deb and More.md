FOSS Weekly #24.04: Huawei's 'Better Than Linux Kernel', CP/M OS, Firefox as Deb and More
======

You may not have noticed but there was a little theme redesign that took place this week.

Thanks to the efforts of [Thimira][1], some tutorial series are now organized in 'course format'. Which means you can easily follow all the tutorials in the series by accessing them from the left sidebar. The right sidebar shows the sections on the current page.

![New course layout for selected tutorial series][2]

There is also an option to move between the next and previous article in the series from the bottom of the article.

At present, [NixOS][3], [Rust Coding][4], [Terminal Basics][5] and [Bash Scripting series][6] have been converted into the course format.

_If you like this new format and find it easier for learning, I'll group more tutorials on a specific topic in the course format._

Please let me know your feedback by replying to this email.

### 💡 Quick handy tip

If you are running multiple terminal windows with different active commands. Then, you can move between windows that are running separate commands by searching for the command name using GNOME shell search.

![][22]

This works for multiple tabs in one terminal window too, where we can switch between tabs by entering the name of a command that is running in a particular tab.

📋

Active commands are those that are not stopped after execution, but run continuously like __top__ , __less__ , __.bashrc__ , etc.
