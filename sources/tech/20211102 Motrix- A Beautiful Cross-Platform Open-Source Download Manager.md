Motrix: A Beautiful Cross-Platform Open-Source Download Manager
======

_**Brief:** An open-source download manager that_ _provides a clean user interface while offering all the essential features to operate cross-platform. Explore more about it here._

There are plenty of download managers available for Linux. If you want to download something and have the ability to manage them, you can choose any of the download managers available.

However, if you want a good-looking download manager that offers a modern user experience without compromising on the feature set, I’ve something that you might like.

### Meet Motrix: A Feature-Rich Open Source Download Manager

![][1]

Motrix is a no-nonsense download manager that provides a clean look out of the box. It is free and open-source software.

You can choose to use it for Linux, Windows, and macOS as well.

It could be a potential replacement for some [torrent clients available for Linux][2] as well.

Let me highlight some key features along with the installation instructions.

### Features of Motrix

![][3]

You should find all the features that you would typically expect in a download manager. Here’s a list of them:

  * Cross-platform support
  * Easy to use interface
  * BitTorrent selective download
  * Automatic tracker list update
  * UPnP &amp; NAT-PMP Port Mapping
  * Parallel download tasks (up to 10)
  * Support for up to 64 threads in a single task
  * Ability to set a speed limit
  * Option to change the user-agent
  * System tray support
  * Dark mode
  * Multiple languages supported

Overall, it worked well with torrent files and detected the download links from the clipboard as well. The advanced options can be accessed right before downloading a file, so that should come in handy.

I did not find any issues while using it on Ubuntu as a snap package in my brief testing.

### Install Motrix in Linux

You get a variety of installation options for Motrix. So, you should be able to install it on any Linux distribution of your choice.

Primarily, it offers an AppImage for download. But, you can also find it available as a [Flatpak package][6] and [Snap][7] [][7][store][7].

If you are using Ubuntu, you should find it listed through the software center.

In addition to these, it is also available in [AUR][8] for Arch Linux users. In either case, you can always get the DEB/RPM packages from their [GitHub releases section][9].

You can find the links to download and more information on installation on their [official website][10] and the [GitHub page][11].

### Wrapping Up

Motrix offers all the goodies that you’d want in a download manager with a modern UX as a bonus.

I recommend you try this out as your download manager and see if it replaces your current tool. I’d be curious to know your active download manager on your Linux system; feel free to tell me more about it in the comments below!
