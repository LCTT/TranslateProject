FOSS Weekly #23.31: EasyOS Distro, New GNOME Features, Compiz and More
======

There are nearly 2,000 articles on It's FOSS. It's impossible to display them all on the homepage and sometimes you won't even know that we have covered the topic you are looking for.

This is why I am collecting useful tips and tutorials on a single topic and put them at a place where you can easily find them.

One such example is this article on [Ubuntu's repository mechanism][1]. I have collected various tutorials and explainers related to Ubuntu's repository management and streamlined them in a course-like sequence.

I hope you like these resource articles.

**💬 Let's see what else you get in this edition of FOSS Weekly:**

  * GNOME has some neat updates in the pipeline
  * New releases of MX Linux and Zorin OS
  * First look at easyOS Linux distro
  * And other Linux news, videos, Puzzles and, of course, memes!
