One of the more-prominent members of the Perl community is [Matt Trout][12], technical director at [Shadowcat Systems][13]. He's been building core tools for Perl applications for years, including being a co-maintaner of the [Catalyst][14] MVC (Model, View, Controller) web framework, creator of the [DBIx::Class][15] object-management system, and much more. In person, he's energetic, interesting, brilliant, and sometimes hard to keep up with. When Matt writes code…well, think of a runaway chainsaw, with the trigger taped down and the safety features disabled. He's off and running, and you never quite know what will come out. Two things are almost certain: the module will precisely fit the purpose Matt has in mind, and it will show up on CPAN for others to use.


One of Matt's special-purpose modules is [Web::Simple][23]. Touted as "a quick and easy way to build simple web applications," it is a stripped-down, minimalist web framework, with an easy to learn interface. Web::Simple is not at all designed for a large-scale application; however, it may be ideal for a small tool that does one or two things in a lower-traffic environment. I can also envision it being used for rapid prototyping if you wanted to create quick wireframes of a new application for demonstrations.

### Installation, and a quick "Howdy!"

You can install the module using `cpan` or `cpanm`. Once you've got it installed, you're ready to write simple web apps without having to hassle with managing the connections or any of that—just your functionality. Here's a quick example:

```
#!/usr/bin/perl
package HelloReader;
use Web::Simple;

sub dispatch_request {
  GET => sub {
    [ 200, [ 'Content-type', 'text/plain' ], [ 'Howdy, Opensource.com reader!' ] ]
  },
  '' => sub {
    [ 405, [ 'Content-type', 'text/plain' ], [ 'You cannot do that, friend. Sorry.' ] ]
  }
}

HelloReader->run_if_script;
```

There are a couple of things to notice right off. For one, I didn't `use strict` and `use warnings` like I usually would. Web::Simple imports those for you, so you don't have to. It also imports [Moo][16], a minimalist OO framework, so if you know Moo and want to use it here, you can! The heart of the system lies in the `dispatch_request`method, which you must define in your application. Each entry in the method is a match string, followed by a subroutine to respond if that string matches. The subroutine must return an array reference containing status, headers, and content of the reply to the request.

### Matching

The matching system in Web::Simple is powerful, allowing for complicated matches, passing parameters in a URL, query parameters, and extension matches, in pretty much any combination you want. As you can see in the example above, starting with a capital letter will match on the request method, and you can combine that with a path match easily:

```
'GET + /person/*' => sub {
  my ($self, $person) = @_;
  # write some code to retrieve and display a person
  },
'POST + /person/* + %*' => sub {
  my ($self, $person, $params) = @_;
  # write some code to modify a person, perhaps
  }
```

In the latter case, the third part of the match indicates that we should pick up all the POST parameters and put them in a hashref called `$params` for use by the subroutine. Using `?` instead of `%` in that part of the match would pick up query parameters, as normally used in a GET request. There's also a useful exported subroutine called `redispatch_to`. This tool lets you redirect, without using a 3xx redirect; it's handled internally, invisible to the user. So:

```
'GET + /some/url' => sub {
  redispatch_to '/some/other/url';
}
```

A GET request to `/some/url` would get handled as if it was sent to `/some/other/url`, without a redirect, and the user won't see a redirect in their browser.

I've just scratched the surface with this module. If you're looking for something production-ready for larger projects, you'll be better off with [Dancer][17] or [Catalyst][18]. But with its light weight and built-in Moo integration, Web::Simple packs a big enough punch for a variety of one-offs and smaller services.
