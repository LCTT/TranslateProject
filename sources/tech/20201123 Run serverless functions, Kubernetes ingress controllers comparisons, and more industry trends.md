Run serverless functions, Kubernetes ingress controllers comparisons, and more industry trends
======
A weekly look at open source community and industry trends.
![Person standing in front of a giant computer screen with numbers, data][1]

As part of my role as a principal communication strategist at an enterprise software company with an open source development model, I publish a regular update about open source community, market, and industry trends. Here are some of my and their favorite articles from that update.

## [Build and deploy OpenFaaS functions: Run serverless functions anywhere you want][2]

> In this tutorial, I’ll show you how to build and deploy functions anywhere using GitHub Actions and multi-arch images that can run on a cloud instance, or on your Raspberry Pi homelab.

**The impact**: Aside from clearly showing how "serverless" serverless really is, this tutorial makes the magic of "it just runs" a lot more accessible. 

## [Kubernetes ingress controllers][3]

> A google spreadsheet that compares the functionality of multiple open source Kubernetes ingress controllers.

**The impact**: This is a for-the-community by-the-community resource leaving the marketing at the door.

## [Virtual Open Infrastructure Summit recap][4]

> Here’s a snapshot covering five days, over 100 sessions, two software releases, and a Foundation announcement backed by over 60 organizations.

**The impact**: As always, it is the use cases from the community that really show what is possible when a dedicated community works together to solve complex problems. CERN is an old OpenStack stalwart; Workday was a bit of a surprise for me (and makes using the tool a little bit easier to stomach now). 

_I hope you enjoyed this list and come back next week for more open source community, market, and industry trends._
