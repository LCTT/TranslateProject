开放原则将如何影响未来工作
======
我们的工作性质在很多方面塑造了我们自己。未来工作的性质将发生巨大变化，我们又该做何准备呢？

TD
How open principles will impact the future of work
======
In many ways, the nature of our work defines us. So how do we prepare
for a future when the nature of work will change dramatically?

如果我们将“工作”定位为获得某种回报的任何形式的付出，那么工作是并且一直是决定我们是谁的主要因素之一。工作是我们生活的一个重要方面。在工作中(不论这对我们意味着什么)，我们结识朋友，我们获得智力激励和情感满足的源泉，我们得到成长，我们感受自身无穷的创造性。对于我们的家人、朋友、社区和社会而言，工作极其重要，我们不应轻视工作的重要性亦或视其为理所当然。

DN
If we define "work" as any contribution that receives any kind of reward, then work is—and always has been—one of the major factors that define who we are. It is a major aspect of our lives. Throughout our work (whatever that may be for us), we meet friends, identify sources of intellectual stimulation and emotional fulfillment, grow, and feel at our most creative and innovative. To our families, friends, communities and societies, work is extremely important. We should not take work—or its role in our lives—lightly or for granted.

因此如果未来[工作的性质将发生变化][2]，这可能意味着恰恰是我们 _自我认知_ 中的某些关键要素将发生变化。我们应该认真准备应对这些转变。

DN
So if the [nature of work is going to change][2] in the future, it might mean that something key to our very sense of _self_ is going to change. And we should plan for those changes very seriously.

考察自第一次工业革命(18、19世纪)以来的工作转变，很多人从从事农业劳动转为进入城市工厂工作，这从根本上改变了他们的生活方式。新的工作方式需要全新的更专业的工作技能而不再是农村经济中常见的手艺。接下来的几十年里，当我们检视我们的个人工作环境时，我们可能会发现工业时代以来的这一趋势可能发生逆转：从层级制度、可代替的通用技术与活动重新转变为横向协作与对专业知识的熟练掌握的更高要求(回到手工艺时代)。

DN
Consider the transformation of work throughout the Industrial Revolution (between the 1700s and 1800s). It drove many people from rural farm work into factories in the cities, fundamentally altering their lifestyles. It required new, more specialized skills (rather than the kind of artisanship common in rural economies). As we examine our own personal work environments in the decades to come, we'll see a potential reversal of the trends we saw during the Industrial era: from hierarchy and interchangeable general skills and activities to the reinstatement of horizontal collaboration and more specialized mastery (back to artisanship).

这个时代与这些转变的到来将是全球性的而非区域性的，转变的速度已经大大加快了。

DN
This time, though, these changes come on a global scale rather than a local one, and the speed of change is far more accelerated.

在这一新的工作环境中，[开放组织原则][3]将扮演关键性的角色。

TD
And in this new work environment, [open organization principles][3] will play a vital role.

本系列中，我将回顾 [琳达·格拉顿教授的作品，_转变_][4] (中译本：转变：未来社会工作岗位需求变化及应对策略，ISBN:9787121152894)，本书成书于2014年(译注，本书原有 [2011版][T1] 与 [2014版][2] )，书中数据于2010年收集，但今天仍然适用(将来也一样)。本书中，格拉顿教授 (Professor Lynda Gratton) 指出了工作将在2025到2050年间如何变化。这是关键信息，因为它有助于我们在准备和发展我们的职业生涯时作出正确的选择。

DN
In this series, I'll review [_The Shift_, a book by Professor Lynda Gratton][4]—a book that, while written in 2014 from data assembled in 2010, still rings true today (and will in the future, too). In this book, Gratton projects how work will change around 2025 and 2050. This is vital information, as it will help us make sound choices when preparing for and developing our careers moving forward.

格拉顿教授阐释了在上述时间段内影响未来工作的主要因素。本系列中，我们将对它们做一个总结并解释开放组织原则如何融入它们之中。

DN
Gratton explains predominant forces influencing the future of work in this timeframe. In this article series, I'll summarize them—and explain how open organization principles are involved in each.

### 影响未来工作的五个因素

DN
### Five factors influencing the future of work

Driving the Industrial Revolution were inventions that used coal and steam power. Today, [Gratton][5] says, five subtle forces are causing a similar "shift":

  1. increased global activities
  2. rapid advances in technology
  3. human longevity and demographics
  4. societal and family structural changes
  5. the need for a low-carbon economy



In short: Computers will become faster. Materials will become stronger. Medicines will cure more diseases allowing longer human life. To varying degrees, these will all impact on how we work in the future. Here are a few notes on each.

#### 1\. Globalization

In a previous article, "[Globalization: A history of openness][6]," I discussed multiple forces and factors related to globalization, one of them being trade. Between 1950 and 2010 the volume of global trade has increased by 60 times, while at the same time transportation costs have fallen. And at the same time, developing countries are seeing not only increased trade but new innovations. I also discussed globalization in early history as part of my article "[Open organizations through the ages][7]." And I explored the importance of global governance—both now and into the future—in my article ["What would a global open organization look like?"][8] According to Gratton, globalization will have an undeniable and unavoidable impact on the future work.

If the nature of work is going to change in the future, it might mean that something key to our very sense of self is going to change. And we should plan for those changes very seriously.

#### 2\. Technology

The cost of computing has been coming down at an alarming rate. And it will continue to decrease. This will help connect billions of people that have been mostly left out of the greater global economy until now. They will start to both enter the workforce and become more influential consumers. At the same time, computers and advanced automation [will replace jobs performed by humans][9] in the future. This all will influence work shifts in the future.

#### 3\. Demographics and longevity

Gratton also notes the impacts that various generations will have on the future of work, particularly in the United States. Younger generations will play a major role in the future, as their attitudes are different from earlier generations. Moreover, birth rates in various global regions will have an impact on prosperity. There will be more migration, as some regions' populations will decline while others increase. They will move to what Professor Gratton calls "creative clusters." And finally, Gratton argues, the life expectancy globally will change. By 2025, 10% of the world's population will be over the age of 65. These people will more than likely want to continue to work for sustained income, continued mental stimulation, physical activity, connection to others, and a source of meaning and purpose in their lives. Also, consider that many children today will more than likely live longer than 100 years. If they retired at 65 years old, they would have 35 years to do very little. With that thought in mind, having several career changes and being active in volunteer and community service programs in the future will expand greatly.

#### 4\. Society

In addition to the generational changes, Gratton notes several important social changes, too. There will be changing roles of women in the workplace, she says. People will have more choices to form the life they want than ever before. And with increased productivity per person, there will be more average free time available than ever before, she writes.

#### 5\. Energy resources

I've talked about the expansion of resource-saving industries in a presentation I've given on "[The Resource Industrial Revolution][10]." Gratton adds valuable points to this conversation. Climate change, she notes, will gradually become a major issue, which will reduce transportation and consumption. In particular, global water supply will not be able to keep pace with demand. Water desalination projects will expand greatly (possibly powered by [Generation IV][11] distributed small modular nuclear power plants (SMR's) now being developed). Environmental catastrophes will displace people and migration will create displaced communities throughout the globe. More energy-efficient ways of living will be discovered and introduced. This will influence future jobs.

### Preparing for the future

These five forces will prompt fundamental changes to the way we work in the future, Gratton argues. But we need to begin preparing for that future now. In the next article of this series, I'll explain Gratton's outlook and a few scenarios for grappling with a rapidly changing future. How could a person look at those changes as career opportunities? On the other hand, what would happen if a person simply _ignored_ those changes to come? I'll review Gratton's thoughts on those questions. Also, I'll also explain how open principles can form the heart of necessary changes.
