5 tips for learning a new programming language in 2022
======
With the power of open source, programming can be accessible to anyone.
Find a project you want to work on, and let that be your first entry to
programming.

Anyone can get started in programming. [We all started somewhere][2], and you don't need to have a computer science background to learn to code. That's the power of Linux and open source—anyone can learn a bit of coding.

If you want to learn a new programming language, we have several great articles to get you started. Below are a few of our most popular articles to help you.

### Comparing programming languages

Most programming languages share certain similarities. Once you know how to do a thing in one programming language, learning the next programming language is mostly a matter of figuring out its syntax and structure.

#### [How different programming languages do the same thing][3]

A great way to learn a new programming language is to write a simple test program, such as a game, to explore how the programming language works. One sample program I often write is a simple "guess the number" game, where the computer picks a number between one and 100 and asks me to guess it. Earlier this year, we ran a series of articles exploring how to write the number-guessing game in several programming languages. Learn how these different programming languages implement the major steps in the "guess the number" game.

#### [How different programming languages read and write data][4]

[Alan's][5] article compares how different programming languages read and write data in the same spirit. Whether that data comes from a configuration file or a file a user creates, processing data on a storage device is common for coders. Alan's comparison article provides insight into different approaches taken by several popular programming languages such as C, Java, Groovy, and others.

### Learning a new programming language

Whether you want to pick up a new programming language or want to explore an existing one, check out the great articles below about learning programming.

#### [How to write 'Hello World' in WebAssembly][6]

WebAssembly is a bytecode format that virtually every browser can compile to its host system's machine code. Alongside JavaScript and WebGL, WebAssembly fulfills the demand for porting applications for platform-independent use in the web browser. [Stephan][7] explains how to create the classic Hello World program in WASM-text.

#### [Cross-compiling made easy with Golang][8]

[Gaurav][9] wrote about learning Go's cross-compilation support by converting a script into a Go program. You can write your program once and compile it for another environment with cross-compilation.

#### [Why I use the D programming language for scripting][10]

The D programming language is often thought of as a system programming language due to its static typing and metaprogramming capabilities. However, it's also a very productive scripting language. [Lawrence][11] wrote about how to leverage the D programming language for common scripting.

With the power of open source, programming can be accessible to anyone. Find a project you want to work on, and let that be your first entry to programming.
