30 Best Linux Games On Steam You Should Play in 2017
============================================================

When it comes to Gaming, a system running on Windows platform is what anyone would recommend. It still is a superior choice for gamers with better graphics driver support and perfect hardware compatibility. But, what about the thought of [gaming on a Linux system][9]? Well, yes, of course – it is possible – maybe you thought of it at some point in time but the collection of Linux games on [Steam for Linux][10] platform wasn’t appealing at all few years back.

However, that’s not true at all for the current scene. The Steam store now has a lot of great games listed for Linux platform (including a lot of major titles). So, in this article, we’ll be taking a look at the best Linux games on Steam.

But before we do that, let me tell you a money saving trick. If you are an avid gamer who spends plenty of time and money on gaming, you should subscribe to Humble Monthly. This monthly subscription program from [Humble Bundle][11] gives you $100 in games for just $12 each month.

Not all games might be available on Linux though but it is still a good deal because you get additional 10% discount on any games or books you buy from [Humble Bundle website][12].

The best thing here is that every purchase you make supports a charity organization. So, you are not just gaming, you are also making a difference to the world.

### Best Action Games for Linux On Steam

### 1\. Counter-Strike: Global Offensive (Multiplayer)

CS GO is definitely one of the best FPS games for Linux on Steam. I don’t think this game needs an introduction but in case you are unaware of it – I must mention that it is one of the most enjoyable FPS multiplayer game you would ever play. You’ll observe CS GO is one of the games contributing a major part to the e-sports scene. To up your rank – you need to play competitive matches. In either case, you can continue playing casual matches.

I could have listed Rainbow Six siege instead of Counter-Strike, but we still don’t have it for Linux/Steam OS.

[CS: GO (Purchase)][15]

### 2\. Left 4 Dead 2 (Multiplayer/Singleplayer)

One of the most loved first-person zombie shooter multiplayer game. You may get it for as low as 1.3 USD on a Steam sale. It is an interesting game which gives you the chills and thrills you’d expect from a zombie game. The game features swamps, cities, cemetries, and a lot more environments to keep things interesting and horrific. The guns aren’t super techy but definitely provides a realistic experience considering it’s an old game.

[Left 4 Dead 2 (Purchase)][16]

### 3\. Borderlands 2 (Singleplayer/Co-op)

Borderlands 2 is an interesting take on FPS games for PC. It isn’t anything like you experienced before. The graphics look sketchy and cartoony but that does not let you miss the real action you always look for in a first-person shooter game. You can trust me on that!

If you are looking for one of the best Linux games with tons of DLC – Borderlands 2 will definitely suffice.

[Borderlands 2 (Purchase)][17]

### 4\. Insurgency (Multiplayer)

Insurgency is yet another impressive FPS game available on Steam for Linux machines. It takes a different approach by eliminating the HUD or the ammo counter. As most of the reviewers mentioned – pure shooting game focusing on the weapon and the tactics of your team. It may not be the best FPS game – but it surely is one of them if you like – Delta Force kinda shooters along with your squad. 

[Insurgency (Purchase)][18]

### 5\. Bioshock: Infinite (Singleplayer)

Bioshock Infinite would definitely remain as one of the best singleplayer FPS games ever developed for PC. You get unrealistic powers to kill your enemies. And, so do your enemies have a lot of tricks up in the sleeves. It is a story-rich FPS game which you should not miss playing on your Linux system!

[BioShock: Infinite (Purchase)][19]

### 6\. HITMAN – Game of the Year Edition (Singleplayer)

The Hitman series is obviously one of the most loved game series for a PC gamer. The recent iteration of HITMAN series saw an episodic release which wasn’t appreciated much but now with Square Enix gone, the GOTY edition announced with a few more additions is back to the spotlight. Make sure to get creative with your assassinations in the game Agent 47!

### 7\. Portal 2

GRID is one of the most underrated car racing games available out there. GRID Autosport is the sequel to GRID 2\. The gameplay seems stunning to me.

The game also supports a multiplayer mode where you can play with your friends – representing as a team.

### 26\. Total War: Warhammer

Total War: Warhammer is an incredible turn-based strategy game available for PC. Sadly, the Warhammer II isn’t available for Linux as of yet.

[Cities: Skylines (Purchase)][44]

### 30\. XCOM 2

XCOM 2 is one of the best turn-based strategy game available for PC. I wonder how crazy it could have been to have XCOM 2 as a first person shooter game. However, it’s still a masterpiece with an overwhelming response from almost everyone who bought the game. If you have the budget to spend more on this game, do get the – “War of the Chosen” – DLC.
