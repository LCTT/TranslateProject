As you see in the above screenshot, it will display all useful softwares. The softwares that already has been installed will not be selected by default and marked with green colour dot. If particular software is not available for your Ubuntu version, then it will be marked with Red colour dot. And, the softwares marked in orange colour will be re-installed/upgraded. Clear?

Now, select the softwares that you want to install and hit the button **Install Now**. The PPA of the selected softwares will added automatically and the respective softwares will be installed on your system. Sounds good, isn’t it?

For example, here I want to install only the p7zip compression utility on my ubuntu 14.04 system. So i selected p7zip package, and unchecked all of others. To begin the installation, just hit the **Install Now** button.

Now, the install will automatically add the PPA of p7zip on your system and install it. Everything will be done automatically on background. So you don’t need anything to do. Just, be relax and watch the installation.

If the software has been successfully installed, it will be marked as green colour dot. Please keep in mind that installing all applications at once will take a while to complete depending upon your Internet connection speed, and it is highly not advisable to interrupt the install process once it has begun.
