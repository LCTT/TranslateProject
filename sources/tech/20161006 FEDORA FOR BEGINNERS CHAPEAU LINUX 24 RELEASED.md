FEDORA FOR BEGINNERS: CHAPEAU LINUX 24 RELEASED
===================

[![Chapeau 24 is released](https://itsfoss.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/chapeau-24-release.jpg)][24]

[Chapeau][23] is a beginner focused [Fedora based Linux distribution][22]. Chapeau Linux has released its new version 24 recently.

As the name suggests, Chapeau 24 is based on Fedora 24\. So you can expect most, if not all, [Fedora 24 features][21] in Chapeau 24 as well.

I’ll add a trivia here. You might already know that [Fedora is kind of hat][20]. I think since [Fedora][19] is a community project from [Red Hat][18], they just named it after another kind of hat. Interestingly, [Chapeau is also a kind of hat][17], a French one. Now these names make sense, don’t they? If you like such trivial fact check out the logic behind other [Linux distributions naming conventions][16].

### CHAPEAU 24 FEATURES

Pretty much what Fedora 24 has to offer. It still runs GNOME 3.20 which is understandable as it was only recently that [GNOME 3.22 was released][15]. Some of the main new highlights of Chapeau 24 release are:

*   [Gnome][10] 3.20 desktop environment
*   LibreOffice 5
*   [PlayOnLinux][9] & [Wine][8]
*   [Steam][7]
*   [VLC][6]
*   [Mozilla Firefox][5] with [Adobe Flash][4].
*   [Hardware Helper Tool (hht)][3] (introduced in [Chapeau 23][2], this tool helps to find drivers for your hardware)
*   [RPMFusion][1] software sources preconfigured
*   Media codecs and DVD playback support
*   Gnome Boxes
*   KVM virtualisation
*   Dropbox integration
*   UI improvements
*   Broadcom wireless chipset firmware
*   CUPS backend for Canon printers
*   Linux kernel 4.7

### SHOULD YOU BE USING CHAPEAU 24?

That’s a difficult question to answer. See, in the world of Linux, we have over 300 active Linux distributions. Plenty of them are for desktop users.

It is up to individuals what they prefer. You can totally install Fedora 24 and install various tool along with it and then you don’t need to look elsewhere. But you might also know that Fedora is quite tightfisted when it comes to proprietary hardware support.

Altogether, Chapeau is a nice to have Linux distribution that gives you Fedora minus the headaches. If GNOME is what you like, Chapeau Linux could be your game.

You can download Chapeau 24 from SourceForge:
