Best VPN Services for Privacy Minded Linux Users
======

No matter whether you use Linux or Windows, ISPs spy all the time. Also, it is often your Internet Service Provider who enforces annoying restrictions, and throttles speed while tracking your online activity.

I’m not sure what might be the cause of a privacy breach for you – but when it comes to utilizing a VPN to secure your network, it always helps.

You can unblock geological restrictions, prevent ISPs from logging your activity, and hide your IP address / location by using a VPN. So, in this article, we will be mentioning the best VPN services for Linux which privacy minded people might find handy.

### Recommended VPN Services for Linux

Some of the links in the article are affiliate links. Please read our [affiliate policy][1].

#### ProtonVPN

![][2]

[ProtonVPN][3] will count as one of the best VPNs available out there in terms of security and privacy.

It is offered by ProtonMail, the privacy oriented service provider from Switzerland. ProtonVPN benefits from strong legal protections because they are a Switzerland-based company. A perfect combination for privacy and security.

You can start using it for free but with very limited features. If you are going with the free plan, the experience will not be the best, but that’s your ultimate decision. In case you decide to purchase a subscription, you get – P2P support, Tor integration, more server locations, high speed, and secure streaming.

You can use the command-line tool for ProtonVPN or set it up using OpenVPN. Refer to their [FAQ section][4] for more info on that.

#### ExpressVPN

![][5]

[ExpressVPN][6] is one of the most recommended VPNs across multiple platforms – even for Linux. Personally, I use this.

They offer a lot of server locations to choose from along with the claim of zero-logging policy. It offers strong encryption and also supports unblocking Netflix – if that’s what you are looking for. Of course, the best VPNs like these offer similar level of protection. So, it’s a matter of trust – and nitty-gritty details as to why you should consider a VPN as your choice.

I would like to point out that they have an amazing customer support – almost instant replies and detailed support via email. For Linux users, you can either download the app or use it via OpenVPN (terminal / network manager). Refer to the [help page][7] for more info on that.

#### Librem Tunnel

![][8]

[Purism][9] has been introducing new services that you can trust for its privacy protection and security. And, Librem Tunnel is a part of the [Librem One][10] bundle.

If you want to utilize the VPN, you will have to pay approx 8 USD per month (or 71 USD per year). However, there’s more to it.

Along with Librem Tunnel, you also get the access to Librem Mail, Librem Social, and Librem Chat. It’s all your own secure space to get things done. If this is what you prefer, Librem Tunnel is a good option.

### Best VPN Services For Linux

There are a lot of other commercial VPN service providers with Linux support. And, they all offer similar services and security. So, we thought of keeping our best recommendations separate (as you read above).

Now, let’s take a look at more alternatives to our best recommendations:

#### HideMyAss

![][12]

[HideMyAss][13] is an incredibly popular VPN service for Linux just because it offers a lot of server locations to choose from. In addition to this, HideMyAss could prove to be a cheaper solution because it offers regional pricing for some (like for Indian users).

You can set it up using OpenVPN via terminal or using the Network Manager by following their [setup guide][14]. In either case, PPTP and L2TP options are always available.

[VISIT WEBSITE][13]

#### Ivacy

![Ivacy][15]

[Ivacy][16] is an impressive VPN solution, best known for its speed (you should have negligible impact on your Internet speed with this VPN). If you are in for at least a year of subscription, you can get it for as low as 3 USD per month (and that is affordable).

You can follow their [resource page][17] to setup PPTP connection via the terminal.

[VISIT WEBSITE][16]

#### TorGuard

![][18]

[TorGuard][19] is yet another secure VPN provider available for Linux. However, you should note that this VPN service is no way related to the “Tor” project.

An impressive service if you are using Torrents often. You get multiple protocols to choose from to easily unblock restrictions on your network – if any. It may not be the most cheapest VPN, but it features a lot of server locations and more types of protocols.

You can download the app for Debian Linux or choose to configure it using OpenVPN.

#### Mullvad

![][21]

[Mullvad][22] VPN is an interesting VPN service provider which simply generates a random account number for you to sign up. You don’t need to provide any other details (like email) to create an account.

Unlike other VPNs, you do not get pricing tiers. You simply pay 5 Euros per month for the service. You can download the .deb or .rpm file to get it installed on your Linux distro. In either case, you can configure it using OpenVPN.

### Free VPN Services for Linux

#### ProtonVPN

Just like we mentioned above, you can opt in for the free plan to use ProtonVPN with limited features. Even if you don’t get all the premium features, it is still a very good VPN service for security and privacy on Linux.

[VISIT WEBSITE][3]

#### Opera VPN

![Opera Vpn][23]

If you are willing to use Opera as your browser, you can utilize its free VPN service built-in to get things done.

Unfortunately, you cannot separately use it. So, you may not be able to secure your apps across the system – however – you can keep your browsing activity secure.

[VISIT WEBSITE][24]

#### Hide.me

![][25]

Yet another VPN service that you can use for free. Do note that you will be restricted to 2 GB of monthly data transfers and 1 simultaneous connection. Also, you will get access to just 5 sever locations. It’s definitely worth a try for Linux users.
