The New YubiKey 5C NFC Security Key Lets You Use NFC to Easily Authenticate Your Secure Devices
======

If you are extra cautious about securing your online accounts with the best possible authentication method, you probably know about [Yubico][1]. They make hardware authentication security keys to replace [two-factor authentication][2] and get rid of the password authentication system for your online accounts.

Basically, you just plug the security key on your computer or use the NFC on your smartphone to unlock access to accounts. In this way, your authentication method stays completely offline.

Of course, you can always use a [good password manager for Linux][4] available out there. But if you own or work for a business or just extra cautious about your privacy and security and want to add an extra layer of security, these hardware security keys could be worth a try. These devices have gained some popularity lately.

Yubico’s latest product – ‘[YubiKey 5C NFC][5]‘ is probably something impressive because it can be used both as USB type C key and NFC (just touch your device with the key).

Here, let’s take a look at an overview of this security key.

### Yubico 5C NFC: Overview

![][7]

YubiKey 5C NFC is the latest offering that uses both USB-C and NFC. So, you can easily plug it in on Windows, macOS, and Linux computers. In addition to the computers, you can also use it with your Android or iOS smartphones or tablets.

Not just limited to USB-C and NFC support (which is a great thing), it also happens to be the world’s first multi-protocol security key with smart card support as well.

Hardware security keys aren’t that common because of their cost for an average consumer. But, amidst the pandemic, with the rise of remote work, a safer authentication system will definitely come in handy.

Here’s what Yubico mentioned in their press release:

> “The way that people work and go online is vastly different today than it was a few years ago, and especially within the last several months. Users are no longer tied to just one device or service, nor do they want to be. That’s why the YubiKey 5C NFC is one of our most sought-after security keys — it’s compatible with a majority of modern-day computers and mobile phones and works well across a range of legacy and modern applications. At the end of the day, our customers crave security that ‘just works’ no matter what.”  said Guido Appenzeller, Chief Product Officer, Yubico.

The protocols that YubiKey 5C NFC supports are FIDO2, WebAuthn, FIDO U2F, PIV (smart card), OATH-HOTP and OATH-TOTP (hash-based and time-based one-time passwords), [OpenPGP][8], YubiOTP, and challenge-response.

Considering all those protocols, you can easily secure any online account that supports hardware authentication while also having the ability to access identity access management (IAM) solutions. So, it’s a great option for both individual users and enterprises.

### Pricing &amp; Availability

The YubiKey 5C NFC costs $55. You can order it directly from their [online store][5] or get it from any authorized resellers in your country. The cost might also vary depending on the shipping charges but $55 seems to be a sweet spot for serious users who want the best-level of security for their online accounts.

It’s also worth noting that you get volume discounts if you order more than two YubiKeys.

### Wrapping Up

No matter whether you want to secure your cloud storage account or any other online account, Yubico’s latest offering is something that’s worth taking a look at if you don’t mind spending some money to secure your data.

Have you ever used YubiKey or some other secure key like LibremKey etc? How is your experience with it? Do you think these devices are worth spending the extra money?
