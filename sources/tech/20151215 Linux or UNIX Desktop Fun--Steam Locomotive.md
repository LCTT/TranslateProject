Linux / UNIX Desktop Fun: Steam Locomotive
================================================================================
One of the most [common mistake][1] is typing sl instead of ls command. I actually set [an alias][2] i.e. alias sl=ls; but then you may miss out the steam train with whistle.

sl is a joke software or classic UNIX game. It is a steam locomotive runs across your screen if you type "sl" (Steam Locomotive) instead of "ls" by mistake.

### Install sl ###

Type the following command under Debian / Ubuntu Linux, enter:

    # apt-get install sl

It is also available on FreeBSD and other UNIX like operating systems. Next, mistyped ls command as sl:

    $ sl

It also supports the following options:

- **-a** : An accident seems to happen. You'll feel pity for people who cry for help.
- **-l** : shows little one.
- **-F** : It flies.
- **-e** : Allow interrupt by Ctrl+C.
