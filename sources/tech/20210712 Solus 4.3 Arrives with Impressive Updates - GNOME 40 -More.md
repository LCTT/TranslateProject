Solus 4.3 Arrives with Impressive Updates – GNOME 40 +More
======
The Solus team pulled off another great release with Solus 4.3 with the
latest desktop versions. We wrap up the release.
![Solus 4.3 Desktop – GNOME][1]

[Solus][2] is an independent Linux distribution that brings the traditional desktop experience with a modern take. The current Solus 4.0 series follows the rolling release method to deliver packages to your desktop. It has its own package manager, `eopkg` which makes it very easy to install software on Solus desktop. Targeted at desktop users, Solus brings four popular desktop environments. Its flagship desktop is Budgie and also offers GNOME, KDE Plasma, and MATE desktop spin as well.

This is the third point release of Solus 4.0 series “Fortitude” coming after prior Solus 4.2 which was released in early 2021. And a lot happened since then in the Linux Desktop space. All those changes clubbed with Solus specific tweaks lands in this stable version.

Let’s take a look at what’s new in this release.

### Closing Notes

Solus is one of those unique distribution which has smaller user base but provides well tested rolling release system. With a different package manager eopkg, independent repository and other uniqueness, it is a well suited desktop based Linux for all use cases. I wish they get the mainstream popularity they deserve and provides a Xfce variant in the future.
