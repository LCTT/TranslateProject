There are several ways that your React component can decide what to render. You can use the traditional `if` statement or the `switch` statement. In this article, we’ll explore a few alternatives. But be warned that some come with their own gotchas, if you’re not careful.

### Ternary vs if/else

Let’s say we have a component that is passed a `name` prop. If the string is non-empty, we display a greeting. Otherwise we tell the user they need to sign in.

Here’s a Stateless Function Component (SFC) that does just that.

```
const MyComponent = ({ name }) => {
  if (name) {
    return (
      <div className="hello">
        Hello {name}
      </div>
    );
  }
  return (
    <div className="hello">
      Please sign in
    </div>
  );
};
```

Pretty straightforward. But we can do better. Here’s the same component written using a conditional ternary operator.

```
const MyComponent = ({ name }) => (
  <div className="hello">
    {name ? `Hello ${name}` : 'Please sign in'}
  </div>
);
```

Notice how concise this code is compared to the example above.

A few things to note. Because we are using the single statement form of the arrow function, the `return` statement is implied. Also, using a ternary allowed us to DRY up the duplicate `<div className="hello">` markup. 🎉

### Ternary vs Logical AND

As you can see, ternaries are wonderful for `if/else` conditions. But what about simple `if` conditions?

Let’s look at another example. If `isPro` (a boolean) is `true`, we are to display a trophy emoji. We are also to render the number of stars (if not zero). We could go about it like this.

```
const MyComponent = ({ name, isPro, stars}) => (
  <div className="hello">
    <div>
      Hello {name}
      {isPro ? '🏆' : null}
    </div>
    {stars ? (
      <div>
        Stars:{'⭐️'.repeat(stars)}
      </div>
    ) : null}
  </div>
);
```

But notice the “else” conditions return `null`. This is becasue a ternary expects an else condition.

For simple `if` conditions, we could use something a little more fitting: the logical AND operator. Here’s the same code written using a logical AND.

```
const MyComponent = ({ name, isPro, stars}) => (
  <div className="hello">
    <div>
      Hello {name}
      {isPro && '🏆'}
    </div>
    {stars && (
      <div>
        Stars:{'⭐️'.repeat(stars)}
      </div>
    )}
  </div>
);
```

Not too different, but notice how we eliminated the `: null` (i.e. else condition) at the end of each ternary. Everything should render just like it did before.


Hey! What gives with John? There is a `0` when nothing should be rendered. That’s the gotcha that I was referring to above. Here’s why.

[According to MDN][3], a Logical AND (i.e. `&&`):

> `expr1 && expr2`

> Returns `expr1` if it can be converted to `false`; otherwise, returns `expr2`. Thus, when used with Boolean values, `&&` returns `true` if both operands are true; otherwise, returns `false`.

OK, before you start pulling your hair out, let me break it down for you.

In our case, `expr1` is the variable `stars`, which has a value of `0`. Because zero is falsey, `0` is returned and rendered. See, that wasn’t too bad.

I would write this simply.

> If `expr1` is falsey, returns `expr1`, else returns `expr2`.

So, when using a logical AND with non-boolean values, we must make the falsey value return something that React won’t render. Say, like a value of `false`.

There are a few ways that we can accomplish this. Let’s try this instead.

```
{!!stars && (
  <div>
    {'⭐️'.repeat(stars)}
  </div>
)}
```

Notice the double bang operator (i.e. `!!`) in front of `stars`. (Well, actually there is no “double bang operator”. We’re just using the bang operator twice.)

The first bang operator will coerce the value of `stars` into a boolean and then perform a NOT operation. If `stars` is `0`, then `!stars` will produce `true`.

Then we perform a second NOT operation, so if `stars` is 0, `!!stars` would produce `false`. Exactly what we want.

If you’re not a fan of `!!`, you can also force a boolean like this (which I find a little wordy).

```
{Boolean(stars) && (
```

Or simply give a comparator that results in a boolean value (which some might say is even more semantic).

```
{stars > 0 && (
```

#### A word on strings

Empty string values suffer the same issue as numbers. But because a rendered empty string is invisible, it’s not a problem that you will likely have to deal with, or will even notice. However, if you are a perfectionist and don’t want an empty string on your DOM, you should take similar precautions as we did for numbers above.

### Another solution

A possible solution, and one that scales to other variables in the future, would be to create a separate `shouldRenderStars` variable. Then you are dealing with boolean values in your logical AND.

```
const shouldRenderStars = stars > 0;
```

```
return (
  <div>
    {shouldRenderStars && (
      <div>
        {'⭐️'.repeat(stars)}
      </div>
    )}
  </div>
);
```

Then, if in the future, the business rule is that you also need to be logged in, own a dog, and drink light beer, you could change how `shouldRenderStars` is computed, and what is returned would remain unchanged. You could also place this logic elsewhere where it’s testable and keep the rendering explicit.

```
const shouldRenderStars = 
  stars > 0 && loggedIn && pet === 'dog' && beerPref === 'light`;
```

```
return (
  <div>
    {shouldRenderStars && (
      <div>
        {'⭐️'.repeat(stars)}
      </div>
    )}
  </div>
);
```

### Conclusion

I’m of the opinion that you should make best use of the language. And for JavaScript, this means using conditional ternary operators for `if/else`conditions and logical AND operators for simple `if` conditions.

While we could just retreat back to our safe comfy place where we use the ternary operator everywhere, you now possess the knowledge and power to go forth AND prosper.
