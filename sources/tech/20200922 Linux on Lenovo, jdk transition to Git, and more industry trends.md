Linux on Lenovo, jdk transition to Git, and more industry trends
======
A weekly look at open source community and industry trends.
![Person standing in front of a giant computer screen with numbers, data][1]

As part of my role as a principal communication strategist at an enterprise software company with an open source development model, I publish a regular update about open source community, market, and industry trends. Here are some of my and their favorite articles from that update.

## [First Lenovo laptop with Fedora now available][2]

> What we are doing here isn’t just a minimal hardware enablement effort, but a concerted effort to evolve Linux as a laptop operating system and doing it in a proper open source way. So this is the culmination of our work over the last few years, creating the LVFS, adding Thunderbolt support to Linux, improving fingerprint reader support in Linux, supporting HiDPI screens, supporting hidpi mice, creating the possibility of a secure desktop with Wayland, working with NVidia to ensure that Mesa and Nvidia driver can co-exist through glvnd, creating Flatpak to ensure we can bring the advantages of containers to the desktop space and at the same way do it in a vendor neutral way.

**The impact**: That is an epic list of achievements on behalf of all of us that use Linux on the desktop. Kudos and thank you to the Fedora Desktop team!

## [jdk/jdk repository transition to Git, GitHub, and Skara is done][3]

> `Mercurial, see the Skara wiki [11].`
>
> `With a transition this large and complex, we are bound to have missed something. If you run into bugs, errors or if something is missing, start by taking a deep breath :) We also get annoyed when the tools weuse for our daily work aren't working as expected, so we feel your frustration. If you run into issues, please reach out to us on skara-dev [11], ping us on IRC [12] or file a bug on Skara in JBS [13].`

**The impact**: This is both a mammoth undertaking and a thankless task at the same time. The next generation (and probably current generation) of Java developers salute you!

## [What are Terraform modules and how do they work?][4]

> Surprisingly, a lot of beginners skip over Terraform modules for the sake of simplicity, or so they think.
>
> Later, they find themselves going through hundreds of lines of configuration code.

**The impact**: Many times in the race to "get something running," people end up shooting their future selves in the foot. If you figure out configuration management when your configuration is still simple, you'll have a much better time when the deployment starts to get complicated.

## [Open Infrastructure Summit 2020 schedule now live][5]

> A critical feature of Open Infrastructure Summit sessions is the collaboration among numerous open source communities, including Airship, Ansible, Ceph, Docker, Kata Containers, Kubernetes, ONAP, OpenStack, Open vSwitch, OPNFV, StarlingX, Zuul and many more. Speaking sessions at the Summit are led by users from global enterprises and research institutions building and operating open infrastructure at scale

**The impact:** The community that is building the OpenStack ecosystem is also doing some pretty cool things with it.

_I hope you enjoyed this list and come back next week for more open source community, market, and industry trends._
