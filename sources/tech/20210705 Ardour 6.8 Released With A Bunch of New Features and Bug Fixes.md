The Ardour team brings a surprise with Ardour 6.8 release. We round up
the features in this post.
Digital Audio Workstation software is used as a central application for producing, creating, and mixing audio. They are very complex applications and capable of connecting and controlling several audio sources to create final audio output. Among the [top free DAW apps][1] that are available in Linux, Ardour is very active in terms of development and bug fixes.

The earlier [Ardour 6.7][2] was supposed to be the final release for older hardware and platform.

Ardour 6.8 release would the final release for older platforms.

That said, let’s take a look at what’s new in this new release.
