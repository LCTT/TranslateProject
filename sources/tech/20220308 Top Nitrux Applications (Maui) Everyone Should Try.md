Top Nitrux Applications (Maui) Everyone Should Try
======
THIS ARTICLE SHOWCASES SOME OF THE EXCELLENT MAUI NATIVE APPLICATIONS
THAT COME AS DEFAULT IN NITRUX OS LINUX DISTRIBUTION.
### What is Maui Apps and Nitrux OS

[Nitrux][1] is a Linux Distribution and a complete operating system based on Debian with the power NX Desktop, which uses KDE Plasma and Mauikit components. It is one of the beautiful Linux distributions today, giving you the best looks and performance.

Nitrux is powered by its native [Maui applications][2], specifically designed to work in Nitrux and all form factor devices – a proper form of convergence. That means these Maui applications can run on mobile devices running KDE Plasma mobile OS and desktop Linux while their functionality remains the same.

Some of these applications can run in Android OS as well.

This article would like to showcase the following Maui applications installed as default in Nitrux OS.

### Top Nitrix Applications – based on Maui Components

#### Index – File Manager

Perhaps the most used app in Nitrux OS is the [Index][3], its default file manager. The Index File Manager looks slightly different from traditional file managers in Linux, such as Dolphin or Nautilus.

The user interface is neat and clean. The icons are menu options are well organized and visually expressive. It supports advanced features such as split view open in terminal options. The sidebar is a little different with its icon-based grid options, and there is an option to auto-hide the sidebar.

I would not detail usual features that are apparent, such as zoom in/out or view modes. They are similar to the other popular file managers in the Linux ecosystem.

Some of the unique features I must highlight here. The built-in Terminal option is one of the best features to quickly check certain items or do some basic processing if you wish while browsing the file system.

Another feature I like in this File manager is the preview option of the files. You can preview images, text files, videos and PDFs without opening them.

Finally, a unique feature that I believe none of the other File managers currently have is the overview section. The overview section gives you an excellent summary of your file system, with favourites, image thumbnails and search options. This gives you quick access to your files, and you don’t need to always go to the usual directory browsing mode.

#### Nota – Text Editor

The [Nota][6] is a general-purpose and straightforward text editor. The user interface is clean and concise. That helps you do your development work or allows you to take any quick notes in a much faster way.

Thanks to the Maui kit, the terminal window option is built-in. If you wish to open a terminal and do some essential work during any workflow, you can do that without leaving the text editor window.

Other features that make it a most desirable text editors are –

  * Syntax highlighting
  * Plugin Support
  * Go to the Line number option
  * Share and Favorite option
  * Autosave
  * Supports dark and light themes



This text editor reminds me of the great Gedit, which is [not a default editor anymore][7] in GNOME. Gedit [has all the features][8] of this text editor via plugins.

#### Vvave – Music organizer

The next Nitrux OS app we would like to feature here in this list is [Vvave][10]. This is a music player with full music management features. It can discover music in your local system, network, or cloud services such as Nextcloud.

Although it is a music player, its primary purpose is music management. You can create playlists, tag your music files and so on. The user interface has several views with album arts, search features and album only views.

#### Clip Video Player

The [Clip][12] is the convergence video player for desktop and mobile phones that supports the Maui kit. It is a simple video player that supports limited hardware decoding, playing from internet streaming services. The Clip video player is based on the MPV video player. All the usual features of a video player are supported in Clip.

  * Hardware decoding

#### Station – Terminal

The [Station][15] is a terminal application and my favourite Nitrux application based on the Maui kit. Thanks to the default convergence support, this terminal application can work well in Plasma-based mobile phones.

It brings a friendly default colour theme and supports split views, tabs, and keyboard shortcuts for touch-based devices.

Station also supports a distraction-free work environment, where you can hide the top bar to make it a more productive terminal.

#### Shelf – Document Viewer

The [Shelf][17] is the default document viewer for Nitrux OS and operating systems that support the Maui kit. It can read and helps you to annotate documents of several types. Most of the major file types are supported, such as PDF, ODT, etc.

One of the unique features of this application is that you can browse the document pages in horizontal mode as well, other than the usual vertical mode. A nice feature is helpful for users using touch-based devices.

The annotation feature allows you to annotate with pen, highlighter and eraser in PDF and other documents and save them.

#### Pix

The final application in this list is [Pix][19], an essential image viewer that supports all types of image formats. The Pix helps you browse the collection of images and tag them for quick discovery.

You can view the image metadata and basic image edition as well. The image editing features to support the below functionalities –

  * Changing brightness, contrast, saturation, exposure
  * Supports layers
  * Cropping and rotating



However, you can not annotate with arrows or add any texts into the image.

### Installing these Maui applications

All these applications come pre-loaded in Nitrux Linux distribution. However, if you like to install these in Ubuntu or Fedora-based systems, you can go ahead and use the AppImage standalone executables from the below link. After download, make the file executable and run.

Note: If you are using Android mobile phones, you can also find the official .apk files in the same path mentioned below!

### Closing Notes

I feel most of the above Nitrux or Maui applications have the same set of essential features such as tagging and other items. The reason is all of them are based on Maui technology. But that’s fine because all these apps perfectly support convergence and can work on your desktop, tabs and Plasma-based mobile phones.

Thanks to Maui and KDE technology, I feel the apps look friendly with built-in dark mode supports and features.

So, what is your favourite application on this list? Let me know in the comment box down below.

Cheers.
