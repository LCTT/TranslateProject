Fedora Classroom sessions continue this week with an Ansible session. The general schedule for sessions appears [on the wiki][3]. You can also find [resources and recordings from previous sessions][4] there. Here are details about this week’s session on [Thursday, 30th November at 1600 UTC][5]. That link allows you to convert the time to your timezone.

### Topic: Ansible 101

As the Ansible [documentation][6] explains, Ansible is an IT automation tool. It’s primarily used to configure systems, deploy software, and orchestrate more advanced IT tasks. Examples include continuous deployments or zero downtime rolling updates.

This Classroom session covers the topics listed below:

1.  Introduction to SSH

2.  Understanding different terminologies

3.  Introduction to Ansible

4.  Ansible installation and setup

5.  Establishing password-less connection

6.  Ad-hoc commands

7.  Managing inventory

8.  Playbooks examples

There will also be a follow-up Ansible 102 session later. That session will cover complex playbooks, roles, dynamic inventory files, control flow and Galaxy.

### Instructors

We have two experienced instructors handling this session.

[Geoffrey Marr][7], also known by his IRC name as “coremodule,” is a Red Hat employee and Fedora contributor with a background in Linux and cloud technologies. While working, he spends his time lurking in the [Fedora QA][8] wiki and test pages. Away from work, he enjoys RaspberryPi projects, especially those focusing on software-defined radio.

[Vipul Siddharth][9] is an intern at Red Hat who also works on Fedora. He loves to contribute to open source and seeks opportunities to spread the word of free and open source software.
