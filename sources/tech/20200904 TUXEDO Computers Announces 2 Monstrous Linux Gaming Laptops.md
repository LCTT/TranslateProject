TUXEDO Computers Announces 2 Monstrous Linux Gaming Laptops
======

TUXEDO Computers is one of the [best places to get a Linux laptop][1]. They’re also a great option if you’re looking for one of the [best Linux based mini PCs][2].

And, recently, they just unveiled two monstrous Linux laptops perfectly tailored for games. Here, let’s take a look at what they offer.

### TUXEDO Polaris 15 &amp; Polaris 17 Pack in A Lot of Power

The [Polaris 15][4] comes in with a Matt black aluminum chassis and a thin bezel for the display. It looks pretty cool (I love Matt color finishes!).

The [Polaris 17][5] comes in with a soft-touch finish and a little on the heavier side weighing 2.5 kg. The 17.3-inch screens should be an attractive variant for users comfortable with a desktop-like experience on their laptop.

With all the clever decisions for its design and build, it offers the choice of both Ryzen 4000 series of processors (**Ryzen 5 4600H and Ryzen 7 4800H**) and Intel 10th gen processor (**i7-10750H**).

That’s great for buyers looking for powerful Linux notebooks with the choice of Intel/Ryzen configuration.

In addition to the choice of chipsets, both laptops comes baked in with **62 Wh battery** for a good battery life, a **144Hz** display, supports up to **64 GB 3200 MHz RAM**, M.2 SSD, and a slot for **PCIe NVMe SSD** (**up to 1 TB**).

All of this is powered up by either **GTX 1650ti or the RTX 2060** — which is great for a Linux laptop enthusiast.

It is worth noting that the **Polaris 15 offers 60 Hz display for its base variant** and **Polaris 17 offers 144 Hz display** across all of its variants.

Sounds good on paper so far — but what about the pricing?

### Pricing &amp; Availability

The base configurations with Ryzen 5/Intel i7 coupled with **8 GB of RAM** along with GTX 1650ti or RTX 2060 will cost you around **1100-1400** Euros excluding shipping charges.

If you stop thinking about the shipping charges, the pricing looks good enough on paper as per the specifications for a Linux gamer who’s a laptop enthusiast.

But, I’m not too confident about their pricing for the base configurations and the choice of 8 GB RAM for a gaming laptop that costs **1000+ EUR**. For instance:

  * TUXEDO Polaris 17 with AMD Ryzen 5 4600H | NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1650 Ti | Full-HD IPS mat 144Hz costs **1.174,45 EUR**
  * TUXEDO Polaris 15 with AMD Ryzen 5 4600H | NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1650 Ti | Full-HD IPS mat 60Hz 100% sRGB costs ****1.124,45 EUR****



In this case, I would prefer TUXEDO Polaris 17 and I see no reason, apart from the size, to go for TUXEDO Polaris 15 for a small price gap.

Maybe I’m too picky — but I noticed that thing because the base Polaris 15 variant offers a 60 Hz display as well. So, I’d personally want the pricing to go down or a 144 Hz screen instead.

If that doesn’t bother you, you will be happy to know that it will be in stock from **September 15** onwards and it’ll take 10 days in average to assemble your configuration and ship it to you worldwide.

### Wrapping Up

It is always a good thing to see more Linux based gaming laptops in the market. TUXEDO Polaris series is indeed something impressive but I can’t stop worrying about the pricing fluctuations after [NVIDIA RTX 3000 series GPU][9] launch.

If you want a Linux gaming laptop immediately, it’s a decent purchase if not the best. But, if you’re looking for the perfect Linux laptop which is future-proof, I’d suggest you to wait for [Intel Tiger Lake chipset][10] powered laptops and NVIDIA RTX 3000 series GPUs for your Linux laptop.
