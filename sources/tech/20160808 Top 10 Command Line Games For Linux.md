### 5. Greed

Greed is little like Tron, minus the speed and adrenaline.

Your location is denoted by a blinking '@'. You are surrounded by numbers and you can choose to move in any of the 4 directions,

The direction you choose has a number and you move exactly that number of steps. And you repeat the step again. You cannot revisit the visited spot again and the game ends when you cannot make a move.

I made it sound more complicated than it really is.
