It started about seven years ago. Iran’s top nuclear scientists were being assassinated in a string of similar attacks: Assailants on motorcycles were pulling up to their moving cars, attaching magnetic bombs and detonating them after the motorcyclists had fled the scene.

In another seven years, security experts warn, assassins won’t need motorcycles or magnetic bombs. All they’ll need is a laptop and code to send driverless cars careering off a bridge, colliding with a driverless truck or coming to an unexpected stop in the middle of fast-moving traffic.

Automakers may call them self-driving cars. But hackers call them computers that travel over 100 miles an hour.

“These are no longer cars,” said Marc Rogers, the principal security researcher at the cybersecurity firm CloudFlare. “These are data centers on wheels. Any part of the car that talks to the outside world is a potential inroad for attackers.”

Those fears came into focus two years ago when two “white hat” hackers — researchers who look for computer vulnerabilities to spot problems and fix them, rather than to commit a crime or cause problems — successfully gained access to a Jeep Cherokee from their computer miles away. They rendered their crash-test dummy (in this case a nervous reporter) powerless over his vehicle and disabling his transmission in the middle of a highway.

The hackers, Chris Valasek and Charlie Miller (now security researchers respectively at Uber and Didi, an Uber competitor in China), discovered an [electronic route from the Jeep’s entertainment system to its dashboard][10]. From there, they had control of the vehicle’s steering, brakes and transmission — everything they needed to paralyze their crash test dummy in the middle of a highway.

“Car hacking makes great headlines, but remember: No one has ever had their car hacked by a bad guy,” Mr. Miller wrote on Twitter last Sunday. “It’s only ever been performed by researchers.”

Still, the research by Mr. Miller and Mr. Valasek came at a steep price for Jeep’s manufacturer, Fiat Chrysler, which was forced to recall 1.4 million of its vehicles as a result of the hacking experiment.

It is no wonder that Mary Barra, the chief executive of General Motors, called cybersecurity her company’s top priority last year. Now the skills of researchers and so-called white hat hackers are in high demand among automakers and tech companies pushing ahead with driverless car projects.

Uber, [Tesla][11], Apple and Didi in China have been actively recruiting white hat hackers like Mr. Miller and Mr. Valasek from one another as well as from traditional cybersecurity firms and academia.

Last year, Tesla poached Aaron Sigel, Apple’s manager of security for its iOS operating system. Uber poached Chris Gates, formerly a white hat hacker at Facebook. Didi poached Mr. Miller from Uber, where he had gone to work after the Jeep hack. And security firms have seen dozens of engineers leave their ranks for autonomous-car projects.

Mr. Miller said he left Uber for Didi, in part, because his new Chinese employer has given him more freedom to discuss his work.

“Carmakers seem to be taking the threat of cyberattack more seriously, but I’d still like to see more transparency from them,” Mr. Miller wrote on Twitter on Saturday.

Like a number of big tech companies, Tesla and Fiat Chrysler started paying out rewards to hackers who turn over flaws the hackers discover in their systems. GM has done something similar, though critics say GM’s program is limited when compared with the ones offered by tech companies, and so far no rewards have been paid out.

One year after the Jeep hack by Mr. Miller and Mr. Valasek, they demonstrated all the other ways they could mess with a Jeep driver, including hijacking the vehicle’s cruise control, swerving the steering wheel 180 degrees or slamming on the parking brake in high-speed traffic — all from a computer in the back of the car. (Those exploits ended with their test Jeep in a ditch and calls to a local tow company.)

Granted, they had to be in the Jeep to make all that happen. But it was evidence of what is possible.

The Jeep penetration was preceded by a [2011 hack by security researchers at the University of Washington][12] and the University of California, San Diego, who were the first to remotely hack a sedan and ultimately control its brakes via Bluetooth. The researchers warned car companies that the more connected cars become, the more likely they are to get hacked.

Security researchers have also had their way with Tesla’s software-heavy Model S car. In 2015, Mr. Rogers, together with Kevin Mahaffey, the chief technology officer of the cybersecurity company Lookout, found a way to control various Tesla functions from their physically connected laptop.

One year later, a team of Chinese researchers at Tencent took their research a step further, hacking a moving Tesla Model S and controlling its brakes from 12 miles away. Unlike Chrysler, Tesla was able to dispatch a remote patch to fix the security holes that made the hacks possible.

In all the cases, the car hacks were the work of well meaning, white hat security researchers. But the lesson for all automakers was clear.

The motivations to hack vehicles are limitless. When it learned of Mr. Rogers’s and Mr. Mahaffey’s investigation into Tesla’s Model S, a Chinese app-maker asked Mr. Rogers if he would be interested in sharing, or possibly selling, his discovery, he said. (The app maker was looking for a backdoor to secretly install its app on Tesla’s dashboard.)

Criminals have not yet shown they have found back doors into connected vehicles, though for years, they have been actively developing, trading and deploying tools that can intercept car key communications.

But as more driverless and semiautonomous cars hit the open roads, they will become a more worthy target. Security experts warn that driverless cars present a far more complex, intriguing and vulnerable “attack surface” for hackers. Each new “connected” car feature introduces greater complexity, and with complexity inevitably comes vulnerability.

Twenty years ago, cars had, on average, one million lines of code. The General Motors 2010 [Chevrolet Volt][13] had about 10 million lines of code — more than an [F-35 fighter jet][14].

Today, an average car has more than 100 million lines of code. Automakers predict it won’t be long before they have 200 million. When you stop to consider that, on average, there are 15 to 50 defects per 1,000 lines of software code, the potentially exploitable weaknesses add up quickly.

The only difference between computer code and driverless car code is that, “Unlike data center enterprise security — where the biggest threat is loss of data — in automotive security, it’s loss of life,” said David Barzilai, a co-founder of Karamba Security, an Israeli start-up that is working on addressing automotive security.

To truly secure autonomous vehicles, security experts say, automakers will have to address the inevitable vulnerabilities that pop up in new sensors and car computers, address inherent vulnerabilities in the base car itself and, perhaps most challenging of all, bridge the cultural divide between automakers and software companies.

“The genie is out of the bottle, and to solve this problem will require a major cultural shift,” said Mr. Mahaffey of the cybersecurity company Lookout. “And an automaker that truly values cybersecurity will treat security vulnerabilities the same they would an airbag recall. We have not seen that industrywide shift yet.”

There will be winners and losers, Mr. Mahaffey added: “Automakers that transform themselves into software companies will win. Others will get left behind.”
