Hello linux-fanatics, in this post i will be discussing some important that will make your life as System Administrator. As we all know being a good System Administrator means knowing everything about your IT Infrastructure & having all the information about your servers, whether its hardware or OS. So following commands will help you out in extracting out all the hardware & system information.

![lshw command][4]

Using lshw will show you all the Hardware information on your screen.

#### 3- Viewing Block Devices(Hard disks, Flash drives) information
