Linux / Unix: jobs Command Examples
================================================================================
I am new Linux and Unix user. How do I show the active jobs on Linux or Unix-like systems using BASH/KSH/TCSH or POSIX based shell? How can I display status of jobs in the current session on Unix/Linux?

Job control is nothing but the ability to stop/suspend the execution of processes (command) and continue/resume their execution as per your requirements. This is done using your operating system and shell such as bash/ksh or POSIX shell.

You shell keeps a table of currently executing jobs and can be displayed with jobs command.

### Purpose ###

> Displays status of jobs in the current shell session.

### Syntax ###

The basic syntax is as follows:

    jobs

OR

    jobs jobID

OR

    jobs [options] jobID

### Starting few jobs for demonstration purpose ###

Before you start using jobs command, you need to start couple of jobs on your system. Type the following commands to start jobs:

    ## Start xeyes, calculator, and gedit text editor ###
    xeyes &
    gnome-calculator &
    gedit fetch-stock-prices.py &

Finally, run ping command in foreground:

    ping www.cyberciti.biz

To suspend ping command job hit the **Ctrl-Z** key sequence.

### jobs command examples ###

To display the status of jobs in the current shell, enter:

    $ jobs

Sample outputs:

    [1]   7895 Running                 gpass &
    [2]   7906 Running                 gnome-calculator &
    [3]-  7910 Running                 gedit fetch-stock-prices.py &
    [4]+  7946 Stopped                 ping cyberciti.biz

To display the process ID or jobs for the job whose name begins with "p," enter:

    $ jobs -p %p

OR

    $ jobs %p

Sample outputs:

    [4]-  Stopped                 ping cyberciti.biz

The character % introduces a job specification. In this example, you are using the string whose name begins with suspended command such as %ping.

### How do I show process IDs in addition to the normal information? ###

Pass the -l(lowercase L) option to jobs command for more information about each job listed, run:

    $ jobs -l

Sample outputs:

### How do I list only processes that have changed status since the last notification? ###

First, start a new job as follows:

    $ sleep 100 &

Now, only show jobs that have stopped or exited since last notified, type:

    $ jobs -n

Sample outputs:

    [5]-  Running                 sleep 100 &

### Display lists process IDs (PIDs) only ###

Pass the -p option to jobs command to display PIDs only:

    $ jobs -p

Sample outputs:

    7895
    7906
    7910
    7946
    7949

### How do I display only running jobs? ###

Pass the -r option to jobs command to display only running jobs only, type:

    $ jobs -r

Sample outputs:

    [1]   Running                 gpass &
    [2]   Running                 gnome-calculator &
    [3]-  Running                 gedit fetch-stock-prices.py &

### How do I display only jobs that have stopped? ###

Pass the -s option to jobs command to display only stopped jobs only, type:

    $ jobs -s

Sample outputs:

    [4]+  Stopped                 ping cyberciti.biz

To resume the ping cyberciti.biz job by entering the following bg command:

    $ bg %4

### jobs command options ###

From the [bash(1)][1] command man page:

注：表格
<table border="1">
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Option</td>
      <td>Description</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><kbd><strong>-l</strong></kbd></td>
      <td>Show process id's in addition to the normal information.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><kbd><strong>-p</strong></kbd></td>
      <td>Show process id's only.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><kbd><strong>-n</strong></kbd></td>
      <td>Show only processes that have changed status since the last notification are printed.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><kbd><strong>-r</strong></kbd></td>
      <td>Restrict output to running jobs only.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><kbd><strong>-s</strong></kbd></td>
      <td>Restrict output to stopped jobs only.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><kbd><strong>-x</strong></kbd></td>
      <td>COMMAND is run after all job specifications that appear in ARGS have been replaced with the process ID of that job's process group leader./td&gt;</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

### A note about /usr/bin/jobs and shell builtin ###

Type the following type command to find out whether jobs is part of shell, external command or both:

    $ type -a jobs

Sample outputs:

    jobs is a shell builtin
    jobs is /usr/bin/jobs

In almost all cases you need to use the jobs command that is implemented as a BASH/KSH/POSIX shell built-in. The /usr/bin/jobs command can not be used in the current shell. The /usr/bin/jobs command operates in a different environment and does not share the parent bash/ksh's shells understanding of jobs.
