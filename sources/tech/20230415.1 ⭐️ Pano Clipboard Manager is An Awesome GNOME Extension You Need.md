Pano Clipboard Manager is An Awesome GNOME Extension You Need
======

A nifty clipboard manager that offers a visually-rich interface and valuable options.

You know, there's a better way to handle clipboard text than just Ctrl+C/Ctrl-V. No, I am not talking about using the right-click menu, either.

But using a **proper clipboard manager** instead. And, not just any clipboard manager, something incredibly useful. I am sure it would become one of the [essential apps to have on Linux][2] if you like it.

Meet Pano Clipboard Manager. Let me show you what it can do.

### Pano Clipboard Manager: Overview ⭐

Pano is an **easy-to-use and highly customizable clipboard app** that offers some good utility in a very compact package (in the form of a GNOME extension).

It lets you store anything, starting from text, and emoji, all the way to colors.

As you can see above, the **copied content is categorized according to its type and arranged neatly in its interface.**

In addition to that, when you copy something, it shows a nice little notification with a short preview of the copied content.

The extension was **recently updated** with a complete visual overhaul and redesigned tray icons, placeholder images, and more.

You can now adjust the height of Pano, as well as customize the background color, and opacity, tweak content types, font size, etc., in the configuration menu.

But, when my colleague Shivam tried out Pano, he discovered it **would also copy passwords from Bitwarden** to the clipboard.

I must say, that is an oopsie on Pano's part. It should have the option to exclude specific applications, such as password manager. Nevertheless, you should be safe because it has no cloud sync connection.

Other than that, here are a few shortcuts that can come in handy while using Pano:

- Use 'super' + 'shift' + 'V' to toggle Pano.
- Use 'Ctrl' + 'super' + 'shift' + 'V' to enter incognito mode for those spicy clipboard texts.
- Use the left and right arrow keys to navigate between items.
- Use the up and down arrow keys to focus on the search box and items.
- Use 'Ctrl' + 'S' to add a focused item to favorites.

For more shortcuts like this, you can refer to its [GitHub repo][6].

So, moving on.

There are similar apps available for Linux and GNOME that offer such functionality; take, for example, [CopyQ][7].

But Pano is a **bit different in what it offers**, especially in such a compact package.

### 📥 Get Pano Clipboard Manager
