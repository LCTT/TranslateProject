## 💡 Quick handy tip

Similar to what we see in a web browser; where we can access the address bar with _CTRL + L_ , the nautilus address bar can also be navigated to using the same shortcut.

This works on the “save as” dialog too, which makes it useful when saving files with names. Just press _CTRL+L_ to access the name part of the file.
