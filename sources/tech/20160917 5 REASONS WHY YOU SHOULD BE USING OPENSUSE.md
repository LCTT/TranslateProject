# 5 REASONS WHY YOU SHOULD BE USING OPENSUSE



[![Reasons why you should use OpenSUSE](https://itsfoss.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/why-opensuse-is-best.jpg)](https://itsfoss.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/why-opensuse-is-best.jpg)

Most of the desktop Linux users stay in 3 categories: Debian/Ubuntu, Fedora, Arch Linux. But today, I’ll give you 5 reasons why you should use openSUSE.

I’ve always found [openSUSE](https://www.opensuse.org/) to be a bit different kind of a Linux distro. I don’t know, but it’s just so shiny and charismatic. The green chameleon looks awesome. But that’s not the reason why openSUSE is the best or better than other Linux distributions.

Don’t misunderstand me. I run so many different distros for different purposes and appreciate the work people behind these distros are doing to make computing a joy. But openSUSE always felt, well, sacred. You feel me?

## 5 REASONS WHY OPENSUSE IS BETTER THAN OTHER LINUX DISTRIBUTIONS

Did I just say that openSUSE is the best Linux distribution? No, I didn’t. There is no one best Linux distribution. It is really up to your needs what you find as your ‘soulmate’.

But here, I am going to list 5 things that I have found that openSUSE does better than other Linux distros. Let’s see them.

### #1 COMMUNITY RULES

openSUSE is a great symbol of community driven projects. I have seen a lot of users complain about changes made by the developers in their favorite distro after an update. But not openSUSE. openSUSE is truly community driven and gives its users what they want. Everytime.

### #2 ROCK SOLID OS

Another thing is OS integrity. I can install almost all of the [best Linux desktop environments](https://itsfoss.com/best-linux-desktop-environments/) on the same openSUSE installation which is not possible even on Ubuntu without compromising the stability of the system. This clearly shows how robust the system is. Therefore, openSUSE should appeal to the users who’ll be tinkering a lot under the hood.

### #3 EASY TO INSTALL SOFTWARE

We do have lots of awesome package managers in Linux world. From Debian apt-get to the DNF of [Fedora](https://itsfoss.com/fedora-24-review/), all do appeal to the users and sometimes play a great role in attracting users to a particular distro.



openSUSE has again brought a great software delivery method to the table. [software.opensuse.org](https://software.opensuse.org/421/en) is a web-portal that you can use to install software from the repository. All you need to do is to go to the link (on your openSUSE OS of course), use the search box to find your desired software. Click “Direct Install”. Done. That’s all.

Sounds like using Google PlayStore, ain’t it?

### #4 YAST

[YaST](https://en.opensuse.org/Portal:YaST) is literally the best control center ANY OS in the world has ever had. No arguments there. You can control everything. Networking, Software Update, all the basic settings. Everything. YaST gives you absolute power over your openSUSE installation, be it the enterprise edition or the personal installation. Convenient and everything at one place.

### #5 EXCELLENT OUT OF THE BOX EXPERIENCE

SUSE team is one of the biggest contributors to the Linux kernel. This diligent effort also means that they have excellent support for various hardware.

With such good hardware support, comes great out-of-the-box experience.

### #6 THEY MAKE GREAT PARODY VIDEOS

Wait! There were five reasons that made openSUSE awesome, right?

But I am forced to write it as [Abhishek](https://itsfoss.com/author/abhishek/) wants to me add that openSUSE is the best because they make great Linux parody videos :)

Just kidding but do check out the super awesome [Uptime Funk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbABy9ul11I)and you would know [why SUSE is the coolest Linux](https://itsfoss.com/suse-coolest-linux-enterprise/).

## LEAP OR TUMBLEWEED? WHICH OPENSUSE SHOULD I USE?

Now if I have convinced you to use openSUSE, let me tell you about the choices you have when it comes to openSUSE. openSUSE comes in two Distributions. The Leap and the Tumbleweed.

Now although both offer a similar experience and a similar environment, There is a decision You must make before choosing which one of these two to imprint on Your hard disk.

## OPENSUSE : LEAP

[openSUSE Leap](https://en.opensuse.org/Portal:Leap) is for most people. It has a release cycle of 8 months which is followed orthodoxly. Currently, we have openSUSE 42.1\. It contains all the stable packages and provides the smoothest experience of the two.

It is highly suitable for Home, Office and for Business computers. It is for people who need a good OS but won’t/can’t keep pampering the OS and need it to move aside and let them work.  Once setup, you need not worry about anything and focus on your productivity. I also highly recommend Leap for use in libraries and schools.

## OPENSUSE: TUMBLEWEED

The [Tumbleweed version of openSUSE](https://en.opensuse.org/Portal:Tumbleweed) is a rolling release. It very regularly gets updates and always contains the newest set of software running on it. It is recommended for developers, advanced users who want the newest of everything on their system and anybody who wants to contribute to openSUSE.


Let me clarify one thing, though. Tumbleweed is in no way a beta/testing release to the Leap. It is the most bleeding edge stable Linux distro available.

Tumbleweed gives you the fastest updates, but only after the developers assure for the packages’ stability.

### YOUR SAY?
