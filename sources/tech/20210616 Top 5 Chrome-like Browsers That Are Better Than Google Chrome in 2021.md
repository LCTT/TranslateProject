Top 5 Chrome-like Browsers That Are Better Than Google Chrome in 2021
======

Want to switch away from Google? But, looking for something potentially better than Google Chrome (and similar) for your Linux system?

Fortunately, there are multiple Google Chrome alternatives that you can try.

Each of them brings something interesting to the table, while also keeping the fantastic compatibility Chrome is known for. Read on to find out more about these browsers.

### Options That Are Better Than Google Chrome

**Note:** _While [free and open-source software plays a crucial role in replacing big tech][1], any choice available on Linux other than Google Chrome should be a good start. Hence, you will find some non-FOSS options as well._

In my opinion, the best alternatives to Chrome are Chromium-based, meaning that they share the same DNA with Chrome. The advantage of this is that they already have feature parity with Chrome, while having more time to add their own.

Also, if you want, you can explore [opensource alternatives to Chrome][2] that are not based on Chromium.

In any case, even if the alternatives to Google Chrome do not seem superior to you, it is worth a try to move away from Big Tech.

The result of this is a collection of browsers that are equal or better than Chrome in various aspects. Without further ado, here are my top five picks for Chrome-like browsers that are better than Chrome itself:

  * **UnGoogled Chromium**
  * **Brave**
  * **Microsoft Edge**
  * **Vivaldi**
  * **Opera**



This list is in no order of ranking.

### 1\. UnGoogled Chromium

**Features:**

  * Removal of functionality specific to Google domains.
  * Blocking of internal requests to Google at runtime.
  * Stripping Google binaries from the source code.
  * Many new command-line switches and `chrome://flags` entries.
  * Forces all pop-ups into tabs.



For the privacy fans out there, this browser will be a godsend. While it may look identical to Chrome, it has many privacy tweaks under-the-hood.

As the name suggests, the biggest setback for Chrome users will be the absence of Google’s service integrations. This also means no more internal requests to Google, Google URL tracking, and much more.

It does not boast anything extraordinary to protect your privacy, but it should be better than Google Chrome.

You can choose to explore and toggle privacy settings at will through the Chrome flags settings as well.

All-in-all, UnGoogled Chromium provides a familiar browsing experience, with a suite of privacy features added in as well. It is reliable and is also compatible with the large ecosystem of Chrome extensions.

### 2\. Brave

**Features:**

  * Built-in ad blocker.
  * Faster page loading times.
  * Brave rewards program.
  * Ability to synchronise between devices.
  * Chrome web store support.



When Brave first marched onto the stage in 2016, people around the world were gawking at its privacy and performance features. At launch, these included a built-in ad-blocker and a new UI.

Since then, the browser has gained many more features, including a rewards program and [Tor][5] integration. This has led it to become one of the fastest-growing browsers.

### 3\. Microsoft Edge

**Features:**

  * Chrome Web Store support
  * Child browsing mode (additional protection and simpler UI)
  * Good PDF editing tools
  * Built-in coupon finder
  * Reader Mode
  * Built-in password generator



When Microsoft Edge first released alongside Windows 10 in 2015, it was widely criticized for being slow and buggy. However, in early 2020 it was completely remade using the Chromium web engine.

This is the same engine Chrome is based on. The result of this is a modern and fast browsing experience. One perk of this transition is the web browser’s ability to run on many different platforms, from Windows 7 and macOS to Ubuntu and other Linux-based distros.

I know, if you hate Microsoft for some reason, this may not entice you – but Microsoft Edge for Linux is a serious alternative to Google Chrome.

### 4\. Vivaldi

**Features:**

  * Built-in translator
  * Vivaldi Email (Beta)
  * Feed Reader (Beta)
  * Vivaldi Calendar (Beta)
  * Highly customizable UI
  * Built-in Ad Blocker
  * Chrome Web Store support
  * Tab grouping
  * Split-screen tabs



First released in 2016, Vivaldi has quickly risen the ranks in browser wars. Originally designed for Opera users disgruntled by its transition from the [Presto][8] [layout engine][9], it has managed to re-implement many of the features lost during Opera’s transition to Chromium.

Amazingly, it has managed to do this all while being based on Chromium (the very reason Opera dropped these features).

The latest [Vivaldi 4.0 release][10] also turned the tables with several features for power users.

While it isn’t 100% FOSS, 93% of its source code is available, with only the UI being proprietary. Considering Vivaldi’s development team actively focus on Linux users for improvement, this could be a worthy tradeoff due to the sheer number of features Vivaldi offers.

### 5\. Opera

**Features:**

  * Built-in VPN
  * Easy access to social media
  * Built-in cryptocurrency wallet
  * Fraud and malware protection
  * Highly visible website security badge



While it has never been the king of web browsers, Opera has always been present in the debate over which browser to use. Originally based on its in-house Presto Layout Engine, it switched over to Chromium in 2013.

Unfortunately, this switch meant that the Opera team was forced to drop some of its most well-known features, paving the way for alternatives such as Vivaldi and Firefox to fill the space Opera had left.

That isn’t to say that Opera is without features. It contains many, some of which are listed below.

### Wrapping Up

Here we have listed a wide variety of browsers tailored to all kinds of users on any desktop platform.

No matter whether you want more features, a better user interface, or something that helps you get away from Google, there is an option for you.

Since all these browsers are based on Chromium, they all offer a good compatibility and user experience like Chrome. So, switch to one of these Chrome-like browsers and enjoy the freedom that each of them grants!
