FOSS Weekly #23.42: Ubuntu 23.10 Releases, Demystifying Subtitles and More
======

Ubuntu 23.10 and its flavors have been released. A major identified issue is that a '[bug][1]' is not allowing users to install deb files using the software center. To me, it's not a bug but a feature introduced by Ubuntu to push towards total Snap dominance.

Fedora 39 was supposed to be released this week but an issue was identified at the last moment and hence it is pushed to the next week. Better late than broken.

BTW, It's FOSS Pro/Sudo membership is renamed to [It's FOSS Plus][2]. The Plus members (previously known as Pro members) will see the Plus logo when logged in. A little cosmetic change to appreciate the support Plus members provide.
