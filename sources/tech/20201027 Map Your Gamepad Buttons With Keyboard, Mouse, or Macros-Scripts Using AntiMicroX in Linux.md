Map Your Gamepad Buttons With Keyboard, Mouse, or Macros/Scripts Using AntiMicroX in Linux
======

_**Brief: AntiMicroX is a GUI tool to map your gamepad with your keyboard, mouse, or custom macros/scripts in Linux. Let’s take a closer look at it.**_

Gaming peripherals on Linux do not have a great reputation, but we do have some interesting open source tools that can make things easier for you. For instance, I’ve previously covered a tool [Piper which lets you configure your gaming mouse][1].

This time, let me introduce you to an exciting open source tool that lets you utilize your game pad by mapping it to your keyboard, mouse, scripts, or macros.

In this article, I’ll mention why you might need it and its key features to help you know more about it.

### AntiMicroX: An open source tool to map your gamepad

Of course, this isn’t for everyone but an open source GUI tool for something useful, why not?

Maybe you have a system that you utilize for media consumption (or as a [media server on Linux][3]). Or, maybe you want to use a desktop application using your gamepad.

Also, you may want to use it to play a game that does not offer gamepad support.

For such cases, AntiMicroX is a tool that you would want to explore (even if that’s just for fun).

### Features of AntiMicroX

  * Map with keyboard buttons
  * Controller mapping to make sure the host detects the correct triggers
  * Multiple controller profile
  * Ability to launch an executable using the gamepad
  * Map with mouse buttons
  * Gamepad calibration option
  * Tweak Gamepad poll rate (if needed)
  * Auto profile support



### Installing AntiMicroX on Linux

![][5]

AntiMicroX offers a wide range of options to get it installed on a Linux distribution. You will find a DEB package, [Flatpak package][6], and an AppImage file.

It is easy to [install it using the deb package][7]. In addition to that, you may refer to our [Flatpak guide][8] or [AppImage guide][9] to get started installing AntiMicroX as well.

You can also build it from source if needed. Nevertheless, you should find all the necessary instructions in its [GitHub page][10] along with the packages in its [releases section][11].

#### [How to Configure Gaming Mouse on Linux Using Piper GUI Tool][1]

Love gaming on Linux? Take your gaming to the next level by configuring your gaming mouse in Linux using Piper GUI application.

### My Thoughts on Using AntiMicroX on Linux

Surprisingly, mapping the game pad buttons was easier than you would expect. I was able to map the buttons with my keyboard and assign custom macros/scripts as well.

Mapping the buttons with the mouse isn’t that simple and may not work well if you already have the mouse buttons assigned for different macros (like in my case). For gaming, it would be nice to calibrate and map the gamepad buttons properly before pairing it up with the keyboard buttons.

It worked just fine with my generic controller. You can definitely try it out.

Did you know about this? Have you tried it yet? Now that we’re looking for interesting open-source tools, do you know about anything else similar to this for [gaming on Linux][14]?
