Switch from iCloud to Nextcloud
======

If you're wary of committing your data to cloud services controlled by a corporation but love the convenience of remote storage and easy web-based access, you're not alone. The cloud is popular because of what it can do. But the [cloud doesn't have to be closed][1]. Luckily, the open source Nextcloud project provides a personal and private cloud application suite.

It's easy to [install][2] and import data—including contacts, calendars, and photos. The real trick is getting your data from cloud providers like iCloud. In this article, I demonstrate the steps you need to take to migrate your digital life to Nextcloud.

### Migrate your data to Nextcloud

As with [Android devices][3], first you must transfer existing data from Apple's iCloud to Nextcloud. Then you can set up two new accounts for your Apple devices to fully automatically synchronize address books and appointments. Apple supports CalDAV for calendars and CardDAV for contacts, so you don't even need to install an extra app.

To export your address book, you can either open the **Contacts** app on your iPhone/iPad or log into iCloud in your web browser:

- Select all address book entries you want to transfer to Nextcloud and choose **File > Export > Export vCard** to save a .`vcf` file on your local disk.
- Import the .`vcf` file into Nextcloud. To do this, select the **Contacts** app, click **Settings** at the bottom left and select the **Import contacts** button. In the following dialogue window, click **Select local file**, and open the previously saved vCard.

To set up a CardDAV account on your iPhone or iPad, go to**_Settings_ > _Contacts_ > _Accounts_ > _Add Account_**:

- Select **Other** and then **Add CardDAV account**. In the **Server** field, enter the URL of Nextcloud (for example, [https://nextcloudpi.local][4]). Below this is space for the username and password of the Nextcloud account. Open the **Advanced Settings** for the new account.
- Ensure the **Use SSL option** is enabled. The account URL is usually set correctly. It contains, amongst other things, the host name of your Nextcloud and your user name.

To create a new account on macOS for synchronizing address books, open the **Contacts** app and select **Add Account** from the **Contacts** menu. Activate the checkbox **Other Contacts Account** and click on **Continue**. You can accept the **CardDAV** entry. In the **Account Type** drop-down menu, select **Manual** entry.

Enter your Nextcloud user name, password, and server address. The current macOS version requires you to specify port 443 (for SSL) in the server address. For example, if the address of your Nextcloud is [https://nextcloudpi.local][6] and the username is hej, then enter the following in the field:

[https://nextcloudpi.local:443/remote.php/dav/principals/users/hej][7]

### Syncing your calendars

Exporting your calendars works similarly. Through the Calendar app, you can do this with iCloud in the browser, on your smartphone/tablet, or the macOS desktop.

First, set the calendar to **public**. This doesn't mean that everyone can access your calendar. It's only used to generate a link for the calendar subscription. Copy the URL to the clipboard. It's not yet possible to import the calendar directly into Nextcloud because you don't need a link for this, but an `.ics` file (iCalendar). Here is how to generate such a file from the link:

- Copy the link to the clipboard
- Paste the link into the address bar of a web browser
- Change the beginning of the URL and replace `webcal` with `http`
- Press **Enter** and save the `.ics` file on your disk

You can now import the `.ics` file. To do this, open the **Calendar** app in Nextcloud, click **Calendar settings** at the bottom left and then **Import calendar**. Select the `.ics` file you saved in the file manager.

Repeat this process for all iCloud calendars. After that, it's time to replace the old iCloud synchronization service.

### Synchronizing events

To synchronize new events with Nextcloud, set up a new account on your client devices (smartphone, tablet, desktop):

- **iPhone/iPad: _Settings_ / _Calendar_ / _Accounts_ / _Add Account_, select _Other_** and then choose **Add CalDAV Account**. In the **Server** field, enter your local Nextcloud URL, which is `https://nextcloudpi.local`. You can see a space for the username and password of the Nextcloud account.
- macOS: Open the Calendar app and select **Add Account** from the **Calendar** menu. Activate the checkbox **Other CalDAV Account** and click **Continue**. From the **Account Type** drop-down menu, select **Manual** entry. Enter your Nextcloud username and password as well as the Nextcloud server address. Don't forget to specify the port 443 (for SSL) in the server address; otherwise the account setup will fail.

**Tip:** If you want to synchronize other files like documents, photos, videos, and so on, in addition to your contacts and calendars, you can install the Nextcloud app offered in the App Store.
