Amazing ! 25 Linux Performance Monitoring Tools
================================================================================
Over the time our website has shown you how to configure various performance tools for Linux and Unix-like operating systems. In this article we have made a list of the most used and most useful tools to monitor the performance for your box. We provided a link for each of them and split them into 2 categories: command lines one and the ones that offer a graphical interface.

### Command line performance monitoring tools ###

#### 1. dstat - Versatile resource statistics tool ####

A versatile combination of **vmstat**, **iostat** and **ifstat**. It adds new features and functionality allowing you to view all the different resources instantly, allowing you to compare and combine the different resource usage. It uses colors and blocks to help you see the information clearly and easily. It also allows you to export the data in **CVS** format to review it in a spreadsheet application or import in a **database**. You can use this application to [monitor cpu, memory, eth0 activity related to time][1].

#### 2. atop - Improved top with ASCII ####

A command line tool using **ASCII** to display a **performance monitor** that is capable of reporting the activity of all processes. It shows daily logging of system and process activity for long-term analysis and it highlights overloaded system resources by using colors. It includes metrics related to **CPU**, **memory**, **swap**, **disks** and **network layers**. All the functions of atop can be accessed by simply running:

    # atop

And you will be able to [use the interactive interface to display][2] and order data.

#### 3. Nmon - performance monitor for Unix-like systems ####

Nmon stands for **Nigel's Monitor** and it's a system monitor tool originally developed for **AIX**. If features an **Online Mode** that uses curses for efficient screen handling, which updates the terminal frequently for real-time monitoring and a **Capture Mode** where the data is saved in a file in **CSV** format for later processing and graphing.

**More info** in our [nmon performance track article][3].

#### 4. slabtop - information on kernel slab cache ####

This application will show you how the **caching memory allocator** manages in the Linux kernel caches various type of objects. The command is a top like command but is focused on showing real-time kernel slab cache information. It displays a listing of the top caches sorted by one of the listed sort criteria. It also displays a statistics header filled with slab layer information. Here are a few examples:

    # slabtop --sort=a
    # slabtop -s b
    # slabtop -s c
    # slabtop -s l
    # slabtop -s v
    # slabtop -s n
    # slabtop -s o

**More info** is available [kernel slab cache article][4]

#### 5. sar - performance monitoring and bottlenecks check ####

The **sar** command writes to standard output the contents of selected cumulative activity counters in the operating system. The **accounting system**, based on the values in the count and interval parameters, writes information the specified number of times spaced at the specified intervals in seconds. If the interval parameter is set to zero, [the sar command displays the average statistics][5] for the time since the system was started. Useful commands:

    # sar -u 2 3
    # sar –u –f /var/log/sa/sa05
    # sar -P ALL 1 1
    # sar -r 1 3
    # sar -W 1 3

#### 6. Saidar - simple stats monitor ####

Saidar is a **simple** and **lightweight** tool for system information. It doesn't have major performance reports but it does show the most useful system metrics in a short and nice way. You can easily see the [**up-time, average load, CPU, memory, processes, disk and network interfaces**][6] stats.

    Usage: saidar [-d delay] [-c] [-v] [-h]

    -d Sets the update time in seconds
    -c Enables coloured output
    -v Prints version number
    -h Displays this help information.

#### 7. top - The classical Linux task manager ####

top is one of the best known **Linux** utilities, it's a **task manager** found on most **Unix-like** operating systems. It shows the current list of running processes that the user can order using different criteria. It mainly shows how much **CPU** and **memory** is used by the **system processes**. top is a quick place to go a check what process or **processes** hangs your system. You can also find here a [list of examples of top usage][7] . You can access it by running the top command and entering the interactive mode:

    Quick cheat sheet for interactive mode:

        GLOBAL_Commands: <Ret/Sp> ?, =, A, B, d, G, h, I, k, q, r, s, W, Z
        SUMMARY_Area_Commands: l, m, t, 1

#### 8. Sysdig - Advanced view of system processes ####

**Sysdig** is a tool that gives admins and developers unprecedented visibility into the behavior of their systems. The team that develops it wants to improve the way system-level **monitoring** and **troubleshooting** is done by offering a unified, coherent, and granular visibility into the **storage**, **processing**, **network**, and **memory** subsystems making it possible to create trace files for system activity so you can easily analyze it at any time.

Quick examples:

    # sysdig proc.name=vim
    # sysdig -p"%proc.name %fd.name" "evt.type=accept and proc.name!=httpd"
    # sysdig evt.type=chdir and user.name=root
    # sysdig -l
    # sysdig -L
    # sysdig -c topprocs_net
    # sysdig -c fdcount_by fd.sport "evt.type=accept"
    # sysdig -p"%proc.name %fd.name" "evt.type=accept and proc.name!=httpd"
    # sysdig -c topprocs_file
    # sysdig -c fdcount_by proc.name "fd.type=file"
    # sysdig -p "%12user.name %6proc.pid %12proc.name %3fd.num %fd.typechar %fd.name" evt.type=open
    # sysdig -c topprocs_cpu
    # sysdig -c topprocs_cpu evt.cpu=0
    # sysdig -p"%evt.arg.path" "evt.type=chdir and user.name=root"
    # sysdig evt.type=open and fd.name contains /etc

**tcpdump** can be used to see the content of the **packets** on a **network connection**. It shows various information about the packet content that pass. To make the output useful, it allows you to use various filters to only get the information you wish. A few examples on how you can use it:

    # tcpdump -i eth0 not port 22
    # tcpdump -c 10 -i eth0
    # tcpdump -ni eth0 -c 10 not port 22
    # tcpdump -w aloft.cap -s 0

**ss** is part of the **iproute2** package. iproute2 is intended to replace an entire suite of standard **Unix networking tools** that were previously used for the tasks of [configuring network interfaces, routing tables, and managing the ARP table][14]. The ss utility is used to dump socket statistics, it allows showing information similar to **netstat** and its able display more TCP and state information. A few examples:

    # ss -tnap
    # ss -tnap6
    # ss -tnap
    # ss -s
    # ss -tn -o state established -p

#### 15. lsof - list open files ####

**lsof** is a command meaning "**list open files**", which is used in many Unix-like systems to report a list of all open files and the processes that opened them. It is used by most Linux distributions and other Unix-like operating systems by **system administrators** to check what files are open by various processes.

    # lsof +p process_id
    # lsof | less
    # lsof –u username
    # lsof /etc/passwd
    # lsof –i TCP:ftp
    # lsof –i TCP:80

You can find **more examples** in the [lsof article][15]

#### 16. iftop - top for your network connections ####

**iftop** is yet another top like application that will is based on networking information. It shows various current **network connection** sorted by **bandwidth usage** or the amount of data uploaded or downloaded. It also provides various estimations of the time it will take to download them.
