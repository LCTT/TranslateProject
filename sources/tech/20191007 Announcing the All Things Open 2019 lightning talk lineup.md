### Why do we contribute to open source?

Open source communities as a whole gain from participants who participate and contribute because they want to. Understanding what's worked and what hasn't worked to motivate in the broader context, as has been studied by both academics and practitioners, can lead to better outcomes across open source communities as a whole.

In this talk, Gordon Haff, the author of _How Open Source Ate Software_, will take you on a quick tour through fundamental research about motivations both as a theory and as practiced in open source projects. Armed with this knowledge, you'll be better prepared to both understand and guide the open source development process.

### VistA on Linux – A complete FOSS stack for electronic health records

The VistA healthcare information system developed by the US Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) is a mature, proven electronic health record system that is used throughout the VA system. Through the US Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), the source code for VistA is in the public domain. Although VistA was developed by the VA for its own unique needs, VistA has been extended to meet needs that the VA does not have, and there is an ecosystem of both expertise and functionality around VistA. Unlike other healthcare information systems developed in the US, VistA has been successfully deployed overseas, including at a nation-scale electronic health record system. The talk will discuss VistA, its history, its ecosystem, and what it takes to deploy it (or at least as much as can be discussed in a lightning talk!).

### #IAmCS: An open source approach for equity-focused CS education

We are standing at the edge of a momentous moment for North Carolina's 1.5 million public school children, not to mention their families and future employers. The North Carolina State Board of Education has added Computer Science (CS) to the Standard Course of Study, and beginning in the 2020-2021 academic year, CS will be integrated into every K-12 classroom across North Carolina. We have a rare and critical opportunity to reimagine education for all North Carolina students -- including female students and students underrepresented in STEM fields -- and to situate North Carolina as a national leader in future-proof learning.

This monumental task of designing, building, and implementing equity-focused CS education across North Carolina demands an open source approach. In this lightening talk, we briefly explain our #IAmCS campaign aimed to raise awareness of the CS Initiative and close the gender inequity in CS. Using images and brief video of female CS leaders across the state, we will explain how the open source principles of inclusivity, collaboration, and community are guiding the campaign, and issue a direct call to action to the audience.

### Organizing open source for cities

Open Source is vital in the expansion wave of smart cities. Yet, where is the sustainable municipal Open innovation economic engine/s, and how do we start them spinning at scale? — Only through structured collaboration and community. The open source communities and institutions are highly successful at this in other industries. In cities, open source is not enough, we also need open data, open standards, etc. As we scale, openness and transparency, interoperability, feedback mechanisms, security, non-bias, privacy, become dominating design requirements. Accelerating the scale of good solutions needs help and structure. There are 18,000 municipalities in the US alone, currently siloed, and meaningful technical and community cooperation is minimal. We need a new flexible institutional framework to advance cooperation and scaling within our interdisciplinary design requirements.

The open source program office is a successful industry construct in the open source world, and we aim to investigate adapting this construct to accelerate and scale open cities; from open source software &amp; services, open data, and standards, to non-bias, security, privacy, access, diversity, and above all TRUST!

### How to start contributing to Kubernetes when you have a full-time job

Do you want to start contributing to cool open source projects but you don't know where to start? How does it work if you have a full-time job? What if your manager doesn't like that you are spending time on side projects instead of your main job? I started contributing to Kubernetes last year as a hobbyist, and I'm offering my experience and suggestions on how to get you started.

### Are you being the right person for DevOps

My spouse has a sign in our home "Marriage is more than finding the right person. It is being the right person." We learned from Erik in The Phoenix Project that the relationship between the business and IT is much like a dysfunctional marriage. In this short talk I'll outline some of the key characteristics we apply through the path of growing and maintaining a healthy relationship, mistakes we can avoid, and behaviors we can nurture. We'll take some time to think a little less about our own needs and get to understand better what we can be doing to be the right person for our counterparts in this crazy world we call DevOps.
