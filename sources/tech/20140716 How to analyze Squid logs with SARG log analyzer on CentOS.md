How to analyze Squid logs with SARG log analyzer on CentOS
================================================================================
In a [previous tutorial][1], we show how to configure a transparent proxy with Squid on CentOS. Squid provides many useful features, but analyzing a raw Squid log file is not straightfoward. For example, how could you analyze the time stamps and the number of hits in the following Squid log?

SARG (or Squid Analysis Report Generator) is a web based tool that creates reports from Squid logs. SARG provides an easy-to-understand view of network traffic handled by Squid, and it is very easy to set up and maintain. In the following tutorial, we show **how to set up SARG on a CentOS platform**.

We start the process by installing necessary dependencies using yum.

    # yum install gcc make wget httpd crond 

Necessary services are started and loaded at startup.

    # service httpd start; service crond start
    # chkconfig httpd on; chkconfig crond on 

Now we download and extract SARG.

    # wget http://downloads.sourceforge.net/project/sarg/sarg/sarg-2.3.8/sarg-2.3.8.tar.gz?
    # tar zxvf sarg-2.3.8.tar.gz
    # cd sarg-2.3.8 

**NOTE**: For 64-bit Linux, the source code in log.c needs to be patched as follows.

    1506c1506
    <            if (fprintf(ufile->file, "%s\t%s\t%s\t%s\t%"PRIi64"\t%s\t%ld\t%s\n",dia,hora,ip,url,nbytes,code,elap_time,smartfilter)<=0) {
    ---
    >            if (fprintf(ufile->file, "%s\t%s\t%s\t%s\t%"PRIi64"\t%s\t%ld\t%s\n",dia,hora,ip,url,(int64_t)nbytes,code,elap_time,smartfilter)<=0) {
    1513c1513
    <                fprintf(fp_log, "%s\t%s\t%s\t%s\t%s\t%"PRIi64"\t%s\t%ld\t%s\n",dia,hora,user,ip,url,nbytes,code,elap_time,smartfilter);
    ---
    >                fprintf(fp_log, "%s\t%s\t%s\t%s\t%s\t%"PRIi64"\t%s\t%ld\t%s\n",dia,hora,user,ip,url,(int64_t)nbytes,code,elap_time,smartfilter);
    1564c1564
    <                printf("LEN=\t%"PRIi64"\n",nbytes);
    ---
    >                printf("LEN=\t%"PRIi64"\n",(int64_t)nbytes);

Go ahead and build/install SARG as follows.

    # ./configure
    # make
    # make install 

After SARG is installed, the configuration file can be modified to match your requirements. The following is one example of SARG configuration.

    # vim /usr/local/etc/sarg.conf 

----------

    access_log /var/log/squid/access.log
    temporary_dir /tmp
    output_dir /var/www/html/squid-reports
    date_format e     ## We use Europian DD-MM-YYYY format here ##
    ## we don’t want multiple reports for single day/week/month ##
    overwrite_report yes

Now it's time for a test run. We run sarg command in debug mode to find whether there is any error.

    # sarg -x

If all goes well, sarg should analyze Squid logs, and create reports in /var/www/html/squid-reports. The reports should be visible in a web browser using the address http://<server-IP>/squid-reports/

SARG can be used to create daily, weekly and monthly reports. Time range can be specified using the "-d" parameter with possible values in the form of day-n, week-n or month-n, where n is the number of days/weeks/months to jump backward. For example, with week-1, SARG will generate a report for the previous week. With day-2, SARG will prepare reports for the previous two days.

As a demonstration, we will prepare a cron job to run SARG daily.

    # vim /etc/cron.daily/sarg 

----------

    #!/bin/sh
    /usr/local/bin/sarg -d day-1

The file needs a execution permission.

    # chmod 755 /usr/local/bin/sarg 

Now SARG should prepare daily reports about Squid-managed traffic. These reports can easily be accessed from the SARG web interface.

To sum up, SARG is a web based tool that analyzes Squid logs and presents the analysis in an informative way. System admins can leverage SARG to monitor what sites are being accessed, and to keep track of top visited sites and top users. This tutorial covers a working configuration for SARG. You can customize the configuration even further to match your requirements.

Hope this helps.­­­­
