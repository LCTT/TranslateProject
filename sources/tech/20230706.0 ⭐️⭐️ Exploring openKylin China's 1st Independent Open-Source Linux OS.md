Exploring openKylin: China's 1st Independent Open-Source Linux OS
======

A new Linux distribution was built from scratch. What's exciting about it? Let us take a peek at it.

![openkylin][1]

openKylin is a new distro offering, hailed as China's first independent, open-source desktop operating system.

Worked on by over 3,000 developers, 74 SIGs (special interest groups), and over 200 enterprises, openKylin has come a long way since its early releases.

The closest competitor to openKylin would be Deepin, another distro that has come out of China. But it uses a Debian base and cannot be considered independent (or built from scratch).

Let's dive into this release and see how it fares.

### openKylin 1.0: First Look ⭐

openKylin 1.0 is based on the long-term-supported [**Linux Kernel 6.1**][3], and takes its name from a mythical creature in Chinese mythology called '[Qilin][4]'.

I installed it on a virtual machine to see how the user experience was. Allow me to show you how it went.

#### Initial Impressions

So, first things first, the installation of openKylin. The **installer was primarily in the Chinese (Simplified) language**. But luckily, there was an option to install the English version of openKylin.

**It was weird to see** that the boot menu read ''Install openKylin with kernel 5.15” rather than kernel 6.1; I guess that is an error.

**So, moving on with the installation**, a language selection screen shows up to choose between Chinese (simplified) and English.

After setting the language, the timezone, and the user account, the **install method selection menu is shown**, where you can either decide to do a full install or go through a custom install.

**Under custom install**, you can select the storage device for bootloader installation and create new partition tables.

After confirmation of the installation method, the install progresses. A **nice progress screen shows** all the usual elements, such as the progress bar, log, and features banner.

**When everything is set**, you will be booted into the beautiful desktop that has a very familiar look to it. It has a taskbar at the bottom with some pretty handy widgets.

openKylin uses the **[UKUI][9]**desktop environment that stands for **“Ultimate Kylin User Interface”** which handles all the GUI-based user interactions and also **extends the functionality of the OS by providing a set of core apps**.

openKylin features a **Windows-like app launcher** that feels very intuitive to use; it has all the essential apps and tools in the right place. You can also set your favorite apps that will remain pinned on the right-hand side.

Then there's the '**Taskview**' mode that allows for effortless multitasking. I tested it out with multiple applications; it bugged out on me once. Luckily, a system reboot fixed that.

You can access it by clicking on the Taskview button beside the app launcher on the taskbar.

The taskbar also features a neat sidebar menu with useful options to control the device and access a few tools.

openKylin uses the [Peony file manager][14] (UKUI's file app). I must say it was pretty straightforward to use and will be **familiar to the users of GNOME files**.

Similarly, the system monitor does an impressive job in providing the required info and also has a familiar feel to it.

The layout of the '**Settings**' app is quite neat, and all the important settings are divided into different sections and subsections.

When you click on one, you will be taken to the respective menu. I tried it with the '**System**' section; I clicked on '**About**', and it took me to the correct menu.

openKylin also features a capable '**Software Store**' for all your application needs. However, remember that not all apps will have a description in English.

Other than that, openKylin features a **decent set of pre-installed applications;** some notable ones include:

- **Mozilla Firefox**
- **WPS Office**
- **Vim Text Editor**
- **Video Player**
- **Weather App**

If you are interested in going through the source code for openKylin, you can do so by visiting its [Gitee repo][20].

### 📥 Download openKylin

With this 1.0 release, openKylin has been made available for conventional **x86** systems, **RISC-V**, and **ARM**.
