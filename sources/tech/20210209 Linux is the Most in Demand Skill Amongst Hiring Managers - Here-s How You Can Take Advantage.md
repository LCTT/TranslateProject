Linux is the Most in Demand Skill Amongst Hiring Managers – Here’s How You Can Take Advantage
======

Linux powers modern technologies, from the internet and cloud to supercomputers and mobile phones. That’s why the [2020 Open Source Jobs Report][1] found that 74% of hiring managers are looking for Linux talent, more than any other skill. If you want to work on today’s hottest technologies, you need to have a solid understanding of Linux.

At the same time, 93% of hiring managers reported they are having trouble finding qualified talent for these positions, the highest level in the history of this report. That means now is the time to jumpstart your IT career with Linux training and certification!

To help more folks earn a qualification to start or advance their IT career with Linux, we are offering [substantial discounts][2] for one week only!

If you’re totally new to the IT industry and are looking for a way to break in, our new [Linux Foundation Certified IT Associate (LFCA)][3] is the place to start. This multiple choice certification exam tests your knowledge of entry level IT concepts including Linux, system administration, cloud, security and more. We offer a variety of free courses and resources to help you prepare, which you can see on our [LFCA resources page][4]. This certification provides confidence to potential employers that you have the ability to carry out the duties of an entry level IT administrator.

Through February 16, 2021, you can purchase the LFCA exam for only $125 (regularly $200) using code ITSTART at checkout.

If you’d like to take that a step further, you can also add our [Essentials of Linux System Administration (LFS201)][5] training course and related [Linux Foundation Certified System Administrator (LFCS][6]) exam to the LFCA. The LFCS is an intermediate certification that helps demonstrate your skills in Linux system administration, and provides you with a credential demonstrating your ability to start work as a system administrator.

The bundle of LFCA + LFS201 + LFCS is only $249 (a $799 value) through February 16, 2021 with code ITCAREER. Enroll [here][2].

Finally, if you feel ready to commit to a comprehensive course of study, we’re offering a power bundle to build a broad, deep set of skills. Progress from entry level (LFCA) to intermediate administrator (LFCS) to full engineer (LFCE), with the training you need to succeed. For only $279 (a $1397 value), you will get:

  * Linux Foundation Certified IT Associate (LFCA) Exam
  * Essentials of Linux System Administration (LFS201)
  * Linux Foundation Certified Administrator (LFCS) Exam
  * [Linux Networking and Administration (LFS211)][7]
  * [Linux Foundation Certified Engineer (LFCE) Exam][8]
  * [Introduction to Open Source Development, Git, and Linux (LFD201)][9]
  * [DevOps and SRE Fundamentals (LFS261)][10]



You will have one year from date of purchase to complete the four courses and three exams, but when you come out the other side you will have three highly respected industry certifications that will demonstrate that you have the knowledge, skills and tenacity to step into a Linux engineering role.

Use code ITPOWER to take advantage of this offer through February 16, 2021.

You can read more about all the special offers this month and take advantage of them [here][2].
