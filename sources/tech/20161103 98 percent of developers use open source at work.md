Open source is already reaching new heights each day. But a new study surfaced online that claims over 98 percent of developers use open source tools at work.

Git repository manager [GitLab][1] has conducted a survey that revealed some interesting facts about open source adoption. The survey, conducted with a developer group, claimed that of the 98 percent developers who prefer open source usage at work, 91 percent opt for the same development tools for work and personal projects. Moreover, 92 percent of the total group consider distributed version control systems (Git repositories) are crucial for their everyday work.

Among all the preferred programming languages, JavaScript comes on top with 51 percent of respondents. It is followed by Python, PHP, Java, Swift and Objective-C. Furthermore, 86 percent of developers considers security as a prime factor for judging the code.

“While process-driven development techniques have been successful in the past, developers are searching for a more natural evolution of software development that fosters collaboration and information sharing across the lifecycle of a project,” said Sid Sijbrandij, CEO and co-founder of GitLab, in a statement.

GitLab surveyed 362 startup and enterprise CTOs, developers and DevOps professionals who used its repository platform between July 6 and 27.
