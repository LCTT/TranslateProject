FOSS Weekly #23.34: Ubuntu 23.10 Features, Bodhi Linux 7, Useful Shortcuts and More
======

Several new releases this week. Lightweight Bodhi Linux released version 7.0. Deepin variant of Ubuntu, UbuntuDDE released version 23.04 (just 2 months before Ubuntu 23.10 release) and LibreOffice released a new version as well.

And the Linux project will turn 32 soon. I know a few readers who have been using it for the past 32 years. It's 14 years of Linux for me as well. How long has it been for you?

  * Expected features in the upcoming Ubuntu 23.10
  * Troubleshooting a Linux system that fails to boot (specific usecase)
  * A bunch of other helpful tips and tutorials
  * And other Linux news, videos, Puzzles and, of course, memes!
