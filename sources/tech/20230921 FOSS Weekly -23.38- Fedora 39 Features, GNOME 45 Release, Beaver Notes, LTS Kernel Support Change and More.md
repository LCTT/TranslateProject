FOSS Weekly #23.38: Fedora 39 Features, GNOME 45 Release, Beaver Notes, LTS Kernel Support Change and More
======

Maintaining a Linux kernel can be a daunting task. Developers are aware of it. That's why they have decided to [reduce the support for all LTS kernel versions to two years][1]. Earlier, some [LTS kernel versions were supported for six years][2].

You don't need to worry about these changes as your [distribution takes care of the kernel version, even if it reached end of life][3]. It's just that something good to know.

Stay tuned for the 'new feature' that will be added to It's FOSS next week 🙊

Also, I forgot to add the link to the unique browser list in the previous edition 🙈 so [here it is][4]
