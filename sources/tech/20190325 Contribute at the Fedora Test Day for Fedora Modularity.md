Contribute at the Fedora Test Day for Fedora Modularity
======

![][1]

Modularity lets you keep the right version of an application, language runtime, or other software on your Fedora system even as the operating system is updated. You can read more about Modularity in general on the [Fedora documentation site][2].

The Modularity folks have been working on Modules for everyone. As a result, the Fedora Modularity and QA teams have organized a test day for **Tuesday, March 26, 2019**. Refer to the [wiki page][3] for links to the test images you’ll need to participate. Read on for more information on the test day.

### How do test days work?

A test day is an event where anyone can help make sure changes in Fedora work well in an upcoming release. Fedora community members often participate, and the public is welcome at these events. If you’ve never contributed before, this is a perfect way to get started.

To contribute, you only need to be able to do the following things:

  * Download test materials, which include some large files
  * Read and follow directions step by step



The [wiki page][3] for the modularity test day has a lot of good information on what and how to test. After you’ve done some testing, you can log your results in the test day [web application][4]. If you’re available on or around the day of the event, please do some testing and report your results.

Happy testing, and we hope to see you on test day.
