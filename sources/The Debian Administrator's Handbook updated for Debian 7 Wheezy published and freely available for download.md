> "We’re pleased to announce the availability of 'The Debian Administrator’s Handbook, Debian Wheezy from Discovery to Mastery'. This is the first major update of the book since the first edition (in May 2012). We went through all chapters to update everything that changed with Debian 7. We also got rid of some really old content that was really no longer relevant. On the opposite, we added new stuff (such as a section about multi-arch), and addressed 16 bugs reported by loyal readers."
