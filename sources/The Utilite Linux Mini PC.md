utilite-computer-3The Utilite is a very good choice for users looking for a Linux Mini PC at an affordable price. This device is launched by Compulab, which is the manufacturer of the MintBox. Mintbox is a little Pc box which runs Linux Mint operating system. Utilite ARM-based Linux computer costs only **$99**, a fair price if we take in consideration what this device has to offer.

The **[Utilite][1]** linux device has **2 GB of RAM** and **4 GB of internal storage**, which can be extended using a micro-SD card. This mini computer supports both Ubuntu Linux and Google Android. If you like, you can also upgrade the device the Utilite Standard which comes with with a **dual core processor** and **2 GB of RAM** along with **8 GB of internal memory** and micro-SD card support. This device is the first ARM-based model from the company to feature Freescale’s i.MX6 processor family and in my opinion is the best way to run Ubuntu and other GNU/Linux operating systems without buying expensive hardware.

The Utilite has single core, dual core and quad core options for the processor and an also support HDMI + DVI, 2x GbE, Wi Fi and Bluetooth. There is also the Utilite Pro which comes with a quad core processor and 2 GB of RAM along with 32 GB of internal memory. Utilite Pro has support for:
