Deepen your creative knowledge with explanatory user-friendly icon-creation design story
================================================================================
Along with quality, stability and agility, Ubuntu comes paired with a team of experienced designers, designers covering more and more corners of Ubuntu and thus imprinting into the polished OS beautiful areas, optimized behaviors, carefully-implemented interactions, etc.

The **Ubuntu designer Matthieu "Tiheum" James**,--the creator of Faenza and Faience--, published an interesting article, centering the creation of several icons, insightful article allowing interested users and third-party developers to directly observe how a professional designer creates icons.

The mentioned icons have been created for Juju as presented in the recent OpenStack Summit in Hong Kong, icons adopting an entertaining nature, meant at meeting the visitors of Ubuntu's stand at the Hong Kong summit, "**we wanted** to replace the normal Juju icons for something a little bit more special in order to explain to people that visited the Ubuntu stand what kind of things Juju can do. We decided to use the idea of an ice-cream with toppings and sauce which you can build in the same way that you can build services in Juju".

The article exposes the psychological ground on which the actual icon-creation process stood, immersing the reader into an explanatory yet easily-graspable journey through finding good concepts, initial sketching, adding perspectives to icons, using different design approaches, choosing icon backgrounds, refining the icons, etc, essentially, a reader-friendly design story.
