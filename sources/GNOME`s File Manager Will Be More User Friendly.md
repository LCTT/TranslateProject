GNOME’s File Manager Will Be More User Friendly
================================================================================
**Allan Day, a GNOME designer, posted a few days ago on his blog a very long article about [what’s coming next in the Nautilus (now known as Files) file manager for the GNOME desktop environment][1].**

What you will read in this article is a short summary of the new design features that will be implemented in upcoming releases of Nautilus, which will be part of the GNOME 3.12 desktop environment.

Apparently, a team of GNOME developers decided to revamp the default file manager of the controversial desktop environment, and bring some of its background functionality to the spotlight, making them obvious to new users.

Believe it or not, there are a lot of new users, those who are trying to discover the wonders of the Linux world, that have no idea what to do in Nautilus, how to copy, paste, rename, move or even access their files… and this is a big and embarrassing problem that needs to be fixed!

Therefore, future versions of the Nautilus file manager will have improved, responsive grids and lists views with big and clear thumbnails, as well as helpful zoom levels, so you can easily recognize your files. An updated View menu, with nicer controls, will also be implemented.

Another important feature that will be implemented in Nautilus (Files) will be all kind of helpful buttons, such as Copy To, Move To, Create New Folder, or Open With, so it can make file operations more user friendly. Also, previewing files will be more straightforward, including a highly anticipated navigation function, so you can easily browse through multiple photos or documents

Moreover, the sidebar will be more customizable, allowing users to add or remove network drives, partitions or remote connections from it, making it as uncluttered as possible. A “Starred” entry will also be available for all your favorite files, along with an improved content selection function, allowing users to select items from multiple sources.

Unfortunately, there’s no way for us to compile and test the upcoming Nautilus file manager at this moment, but we will let you know when the first development version is out. We remind everyone that Nautilus is also the default file manager for the Ubuntu Linux operating system.
