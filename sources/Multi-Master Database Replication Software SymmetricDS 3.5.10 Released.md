SymmetricDS 3.5.10 supports multiple subscribers with one-direction or bi-directional asynchronous data replication and uses technologies to replicate tables between relational databases.

### Highlights of SymmetricDS 3.5.10: ###

• sym_pkg is hard coded in the Oracle dialect, but the prefix parameter now works on Oracle;
• The memory footprint usage is now improved when big lobs are in flight;
• Statements are no longer being prepared too often and the data loading performance on Firebird has been improved;
• The error message provided if a batch fails to transport because of an EOF error is now a lot more intuitive.
