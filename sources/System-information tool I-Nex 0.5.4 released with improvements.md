System-information tool I-Nex 0.5.4 released with improvements
================================================================================
[I-Nex][1] is a free open-source handy system-information tool, gathering, categorizing and displaying relevant informations about one's computer into a clean, clear interface.

Essentially, I-Nex exposes a significant amount of details about system components, among which drives, kernel, RAM, network, USB, CPU, GPU, motherboard, audio, allowing the user to easily grasp informations about one's computer and operating system.

Launching I-Nex, presents its main window and several tabs, clicking on a tab, populates the window with related informations, clicking on another tab, repopulates the main view with according details; for example, clicking on the `CPU` tab, displays informations about one's CPU featuring name, frequency, family, mode, extensions, cache, etc, basically, a handy bundle of informations.

I-Nex has been updated to version **0.5.4**, continuing its road on adding new features, extended support and under-the-hood enhancements.

The new version enriches its tabs with new entries, as in the case of `GPU`; hitting the `GPU` tab, the user is to notice the new `Total Memory`, `Monitor name`, `Manufacturer`, `Serial number` entries, new details increasing the level of descriptions of system components.
