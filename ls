 Meet StartUbuntu, interesting open-for-participation project aimed at further spreading Ubuntu's adoption 
================================================================================
Ubuntu is a powerful, solid and no-compromise operating system centering numerous features, professional designs and user-centric interactions, OS used by 20 million users across the globe.

Ubuntu has both power and looks, therefore, awareness has the capacity to always increase its number of users, awareness at a planetary scale having the capacity to extend Ubuntu's usage deeper and deeper all over Earth.

[StartUbuntu](https://launchpad.net/startubuntu) is an interesting full-of-potential initiative created by third-party users concerned with the now's OS-usage percentages at a global scale, project designed in mind with pushing Ubuntu into the hands of more and more users.

A definitely exciting aspect of the StartUbuntu project is its clarity and sharp focus, meaning, the project aims at attracting users from Windows XP via a handy strategy: offering the full Ubuntu family of flavors to users of Windows XP seeking to change their OS.

The Ubuntu alternative is to be offered to former XP users due to XP's end-of-life reaching in April 8th, 2014 (and thus its users looking for a new OS).

The StartUbuntu project has just been resurrected, moving itself to version 2 of the project with refreshed goals and more strengthened precisely-conceived action phases, including:

- phase 0 (define the project and clearly expose its goals in the open)
- phase 1 (build an open-for-participation team)
- phase 2 (strengthen communication means within the newly-created team)
- phase 3 (incarnating informations about why Ubuntu is better and more suitable for users, as compared against its proprietary competition)
- phase 4 (approach and engage with potentially-useful communities, foundations, projects, etc, in order to solidify the manner of reaching XP users)
- phase 5 (reaching the actual XP users)
- phase 6 (further continue and expand the previously-mentioned actions)

The StartUbuntu project is open to every user interested in spreading Ubuntu, participation and complete details available on [https://wiki.ubuntu.com/StartUbuntu](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/StartUbuntu)
